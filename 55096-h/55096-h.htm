<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>So far as I know, this is the first attempt at a systematic
classification of the whole American race
on the basis of language. I do not overlook Dr.
Latham’s meritorious effort nearly forty years ago;
but the deficiency of material at that time obliged
him to depart from the linguistic scheme and accept
other guides.</p>

<p>While not depreciating the value of physical data,
of culture and traditional history, I have constantly
placed these subordinate to relationship as indicated
by grammar and lexicography. There are well-known
examples in the ethnography of other races,
where reliance on language alone would lead the investigator
astray; but all serious students of the
native American tribes are united in the opinion
that with them no other clue can compare to it in
general results. Consequently the Bureau of Ethnology
of the United States and the similar departments
in the governments of Canada and Mexico
have agreed in adopting officially the linguistic classification
for the aboriginal population within their
several territories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherever the material permitted it, I have ranked
the grammatic structure of a language superior to its
lexical elements in deciding upon relationship. In
this I follow the precepts and examples of students of
the Aryan and Semitic stocks; although their methods
have been rejected by some who have written on
American tongues. As for myself, I am abidingly
convinced that the morphology of any language
whatever is its most permanent and characteristic
feature.</p>

<p>It has been my effort to pay especial attention to
those portions of the continent whose ethnography
remains obscure. The publications of official bodies,
as well as those of numerous societies and individuals,
have cleared up most of the difficulties in that
portion of the continent north of Mexico; hence it is
to the remainder that I have given greater space.
The subject, however, is so vast, and the material so
abundant, that I fear the reader may be disappointed
by the brevity of the descriptions I have allowed to
the several stocks.</p>

<p>The outlines of the classification and the general
arrangement of the material are those which for
several years I have adopted in my lecture courses
before the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia.
In fact, this volume may properly be regarded
as an expansion of the ninth lecture&mdash;that
on “The American Race,”&mdash;in my lectures on general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
ethnography, published last year under the title
“Races and Peoples.”</p>

<p>In defining the locations of the various tribes, I
have encountered many difficulties from their frequent
removals. As a rule I have assigned a tribe
the location where it was first encountered and identified
by the white explorers; though sometimes I
have preferred some later location where its activity
was longest known.</p>

<p>The great variety of the orthography of tribal
names has led me to follow the rule of selecting that
which is locally the most usual. This variety has
been not a little increased by what seems to me the
pedantry of many learned writers, who insist on spelling
every native name they mention according to
some phonetic system of their own devising&mdash;thus
adding to the already lamentable orthographic confusion.</p>

<p>I have not thought it advisable to adopt terminations
to designate stocks as distinguished from
tribes. The Bureau of Ethnology has adopted for
stocks the termination <i>an</i>, as “Algonkian,” “Siouian.”
This frequently gives terms of strange appearance,
and is open to some other objections. It
would be desirable to have this question of terminology
decided by the International Congress of
Americanists, on some plan applicable to French,
German and Spanish, as well as English, rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
than to have it left to a local body or a single
authority.</p>

<p>My thanks are due Mr. H. W. Henshaw, editor of
the <i>American Anthropologist</i>, for revising the list of
North Pacific Coast Stocks, and various suggestions.</p>

<p>I regret that I have not been able to avail myself
of the unpublished material in the Bureau of Ethnology
at Washington; but access to this was denied
me except under the condition that I should not use
in any published work the information thus obtained;
a proviso scarcely so liberal as I had expected.</p>

<h1>THE AMERICAN RACE.</h1>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTORY">INTRODUCTORY.</h2>

<h3>RACIAL HISTORY AND CHARACTERISTICS.</h3>

<p>The differentiation of the species Man into various
races, with permanent traits and inhabiting definite
areas, took place early in the present geologic
epoch. Of these races there are four which are well-marked,
each developed in one of the continental areas
as they existed at the time referred to. They are the
Eurafrican or white, the Austafrican or black, the
Asian or yellow, and the American or red race. The
color-names given them are merely approximations,
and are retained for the sake of convenience, and as
expressing a general and obvious characteristic.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The American race was that which was found occupying
the whole of the New World when it first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
became revealed to Europeans. Its members are
popularly known as “Indians,” or “American Indians,”
because Columbus thought that the western
islands which he discovered were part of India; and
his error has been perpetuated in the usually received
appellation of its inhabitants. To the ethnographer,
however, they are the only “Americans,” and their
race is the “American Race.”</p>

<p>When investigation proved that the continent was
not a part of Asia, but a vast independent land-area
surrounded by wide oceans, the learned began to puzzle
themselves with the problem of the origin of its
inhabitants. The Hebrew myths of the creation of
man and of a universal deluge in which the whole
species perished except a few in Western Asia, for a
long time controlled the direction of such speculations.
The wildest as well as the most diverse hypotheses
were brought forward and defended with
great display of erudition. One of the most curious
was that which advanced the notion that the Americans
were the descendants of the ten “lost tribes of
Israel.” No one, at present, would acknowledge
himself a believer in this theory; but it has not
proved useless, as we owe to it the publication of
several most valuable works.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Another equally vain dream was that of “the lost
Atlantis,” a great island or land-connection which
was imagined to have existed within recent times between
Northern Africa and South America. A reminiscence
of it was supposed to have survived in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
story of the Egyptian priests preserved by Plato, that
beyond the Pillars of Hercules was a great island
which had since sunk in the sea. The account may
have referred to the Canary Islands, but certainly not
to any land-bridge across the Atlantic to the American
Continent. Such did exist, indeed, but far back
in the Eocene period of the Tertiary, long before man
appeared on the scene. The wide difference between
the existing flora and fauna of Africa and South
America proves that there has been no connection in
the lifetime of the present species.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Scarcely less incredible are the theories which still
have some distinguished advocates, that the continent
was peopled from Polynesia, or directly from
Japan or China. Several laborious works have been
compiled with reference to “Fu Sang,” a land referred
to as east of China, and identified by these
writers with Mexico. A distinguished ethnologist
has recently published a map showing the courses by
which he supposes the Japanese arrived in America.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It is not impossible that in recent centuries some
junks may have drifted on the Northwest coast. But
their crews would undoubtedly have been promptly
slaughtered; and it is only in later ages that the
Chinese or Japanese constructed such junks. The
theory, therefore, offers no solution to the problem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Still less does that in reference to the Polynesians.
They had no such craft as junks, and though bold
navigators, were wholly unprepared to survive so
long a voyage as from the nearest of the islands of
Oceanica to the coast of America. Moreover, we
have satisfactory proof that the eastern islands of
Polynesia were peopled from the western islands at a
recent date, that is, within two thousand years.</p>

<p>Probably the favorite theory at the present day is
that the first inhabitants of the New World came
from northeastern Asia, either by the Aleutian islands
or across Behring Strait. Concerning the Aleutian
islands we know by the evidence of language and
archæology that they were first peopled from America,
and not from Asia. Moreover, they are separated one
from the other in places by hundreds of miles of a
peculiarly stormy and dangerous sea.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It is otherwise with Behring Straits. From East
Cape in Siberia one can see the American shore, and
when first explored the tribes on each side were in
frequent communication. No doubt this had been
going on for a long time, and thus they had influenced
each other in blood and culture. But so long as
we have any knowledge of the movings at this point,
they have been <i>from</i> America into Asia, the Eskimos
pushing their settlements along the Asian coast. It
will be replied that we should look to a period anterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to the Eskimos. Any migration at that remote
epoch is refuted by other considerations. We know
that Siberia was not peopled till late in the Neolithic
times, and what is more, that the vicinity of the
strait and the whole coast of Alaska were, till a very
modern geologic period, covered by enormous glaciers
which would have prevented any communication between
the two continents.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> These considerations reduce
any possible migrations at this point to such as
may have taken place long after America, both North
and South, possessed a widespread population.</p>

<p>The question which should be posed as preliminary
to all such speculations is, <i>When</i> did man first appear
on this isolated continent?</p>

<p>To answer this we must study its later geological
history, the events which have occurred since the
close of the Tertiary, that is, during the Quaternary
age.</p>

<p>In North and also in South America that age was
characterized by one notable event, which impressed
its presence by lasting memorials on the surface of
the continent. This was the formation of a series
of enormous glaciers, covering the soil of nearly half
the temperate zones with a mass of ice thousands
of feet in thickness. The period of its presence is
called the Great Ice Age or the Glacial Epoch. Beyond
the immediate limits of the ice it may not have
been a season of extreme cold, for glaciers form more
rapidly when the temperature is not much below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
freezing point. Nor was it continuous. The ice
sheet receded once, if not twice, causing an “interglacial”
epoch, when the climate was comparatively
mild. After this interim it seems to have advanced
again with renewed might, and to have extended its
crystalline walls down to about the fortieth parallel
of latitude, touching the Atlantic near Boston and
New York harbors, and stretching nearly across the
continent in an irregular line, generally a little north
of the Ohio and a little south of the Missouri rivers.
Enormous ice masses covered the Pacific Slope as far
south as the mouth of the Columbia river, and extended
over 1200 miles along the coast, submerging
the whole of Queen Charlotte and Vancouver islands
and the neighboring coast of British Columbia, which
at that time were depressed about two hundred feet
below the present level. The ice also covered for
four hundred miles or more the plateau or Great
Basin between the Rocky Mountains and the Coast
Range, rising in some places in a solid mass five or
six thousand feet above the soil.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The melting of the second glacial inroad began at
the east, and on the Pacific coast has not yet ceased.
Its margin across the continent is still distinctly defined
by a long line of débris piled up in “moraines,”
and by a fringe of gravel and sand called the “overwash,”
carried from these by the mighty floods which
accompanied the great thaw. This period of melting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
is the “Post-glacial Era.” It was accompanied by
extensive changes in the land-levels and in temperature.</p>

<p>In the glacial and early post-glacial periods, the
northern regions of the continent and the bottom of
the Northern Atlantic were considerably above their
present levels; but in the late post-glacial or “Champlain”
period the land had sunk so much that at
Lake Champlain it was five hundred feet lower than
now, and at New York Harbor ten feet lower. The
St. Lawrence river was then an arm of the sea, Lake
Champlain was a deep bay, and the mouth of the
Delaware river was where the city of Trenton now
stands, the river itself being a wide inlet.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The climate, which in the early post-glacial period
had been so cold that the reindeer enjoyed an agreeable
home as far south as Kentucky, changed to such
mildness that two species of elephants, the giant sloth
and the peccary, found congenial pasturage in the
Upper Ohio and Delaware Valleys.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The interest which this piece of geologic history
has for us in this connection is the presence of man
in America during all the time that these tremendous
events were taking place. We know he was there,
from the evidence he has left behind him in the various
strata and deposits attributable to the different
agencies I have described. How far back his most
ancient relics carry us, is not quite clear. By some,
the stone implements from Table Mountain, California,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and a skull found in the auriferous gravel in
Calaveras county, California, are claimed to antedate
any relics east of the mountains. These stone utensils
are, however, too perfect, they speak for a too
specialized condition of the arts, to be attributable to a
primitive condition of man; and as for the Calaveras
skull, the record of its discovery is too unsatisfactory.
Furthermore, in a volcanic country such as the Pacific
coast, phenomena of elevation and subsidence
occur with rapidity, and do not offer the same evidence
of antiquity as in more stable lands.</p>

<p>This is an important point, and applies to a series
of archæological discoveries which have been announced
from time to time from the Pacific coast.
Thus, in Nicaragua, human foot-prints have been
found in compact tufa at a depth of twenty-one feet
beneath the surface soil, and overlaid by repeated
later volcanic deposits. But a careful examination of
all their surroundings, especially of the organic remains
at a yet greater depth, leads inevitably to the
conclusion that these foot-prints cannot be ascribed
to any very remote antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The singular changes
in the Pacific seaboard are again illustrated along the
coast of Ecuador and Peru. For some sixty miles
north and south near the mouth of the Esmeraldas
river there is a deposit of marine clay six or eight
feet thick underlying the surface soil in a continuous
stratum. Under this again is a horizon of sand and
loam containing rude stone implements, and what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
significant, fragments of rough pottery and gold ornaments.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
This shows conclusively that an extensive
and prolonged subsidence took place in that locality
not only after man reached there, but after he had
developed the important art of the manufacture of
clay vessels. This was certainly not at the beginning
of his appearance on the scene; and the theory of any
vast antiquity for such relics is not tenable.</p>

<p>The lowest, that is, the oldest, deposit on the eastern
coast in which any relics of human industry are
claimed to have been found, is that known as the
“Columbian gravel.” This is considered by geologists
to have been formed in the height of the first
glacial period. From its undisturbed layers have
been exhumed stones bearing the marks of rough
shaping, so as to serve the purpose of rude primitive
weapons.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>During the first or main Inter-glacial Period was
deposited the “modified drift.” In a terrace of this
material on the Mississippi, near Little Falls, Minnesota,
Miss Babbitt found numerous quartz chips
regarded by competent archæologists as artificial
products.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> They represent the refuse of an early
workshop near the quartz veins in that vicinity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
were cast aside by the pristine implement-maker
when the Minnesota glacier was receding for the last
time, but still lifted its icy walls five or ten miles
above the present site of Little Falls.</p>

<p>The extensive beds of loess which cover many
thousand square miles in the Central United States
are referred to the second Glacial Epoch. Professor
Aughey reports the finding of rudely chipped arrowhead
in this loess as it occurs in the Missouri Valley.
They lay immediately beneath the vertebra of an
elephant, an animal, I need scarcely add, long since
extinct. Another proof of man’s presence about that
date is a primitive hearth discovered in digging a
well along the old beach of Lake Ontario. According
to that competent geologist, Professor Gilbert,
this dated from a period when the northern shore of
that body of water was the sheer wall of a mighty
glacier, and the channel of the Niagara river had not
yet begun to be furrowed out of the rock by the receding
waters.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Other finds which must be referred
to about this epoch are those by McGee of a chipped
obsidian implement in the lacustrine marls of western
Nevada; and that of a fragment of a human skull in
the westernmost extension of the loess in Colorado.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>More conclusive than these are the repeated discoveries
of implements, chipped from hard stones, in
deposits of loess and gravels in Ohio and Indiana,
which deposits, without doubt, represent a closing
episode of the last Glacial Epoch. There may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
some question about the geologic age of the former
finds, but about these there is none. They prove beyond
cavil that during the closing scenes of the Quaternary
in North America, man, tool-making, fire-using
man, was present and active.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This decision
is not only confirmed, but greatly extended, by the
researches of Dr. C. C. Abbott and others in the
gravels about Trenton, on the Delaware. These
were laid down contemporaneously with the terminal
moraine in Ohio and Indiana, from which the palæoliths
were exhumed. Abbott’s discoveries include
several hundred stone implements of the true palæolithic
or “Chelléen” type, and some fragments of
human skeletons.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> They reveal to us not only the
presence of man, but a well defined stage of culture
strictly comparable to that of the “river drift” men
of the Thames and the Somme in western Europe,
which has been so ably described by De Mortillet.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Such discoveries have not been confined to the
northern portion of the continent. Barcena reported
the relics of man in a quaternary rock in the valley
of Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The geologists of the Argentine Republic
describe others which must be referred to a very
remote age. The writers who have given the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
information about them are Ameghino and Burmeister.
They found bone and stone implements of rude
form and the remains of hearths associated with
bones of the extinct horse, the glyptodon, and other
animals now unknown. The stratigraphic relations
of the finds connected them with the deposits of the
receding Austral glacier.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Such facts as these place it beyond doubt that man
lived in both North and South America at the close
of the Glacial Age. It is not certain that this close
was synchronous in both the northern and southern
hemispheres, nor that the American glacier was contemporary
with the Ice Age of Europe. The able
geologist, Mr. Croll, is of opinion that if there was a
difference in time, the Ice Age of America was posterior
to that of Europe. In any case, the extreme
antiquity of man in America is placed beyond cavil.
He was here long before either northern Asia or the
Polynesian islands were inhabited, as it is well
known they were first populated in Neolithic times.</p>

<p>The question naturally arises, did he not originate
upon this continent? The answer to this is given by
Charles Darwin in his magistral statement&mdash;“Our
progenitors diverged from the catarhine stock of the
anthropoids; and the fact that they belonged to this
stock clearly shows that they inhabited the Old
World.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In fact, all the American monkeys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
whether living or fossil, are platyrhine, have thirty-four
teeth, and have tails, characteristics which show
that none of the higher anthropoids lived in the New
World.</p>

<p>We are obliged, therefore, to look for the original
home of the American glacial man elsewhere than
in America. Some interesting geological facts throw
an unexpected light upon our investigations. I have
already remarked that in the various recent oscillations
of the earth’s crust, there occurred about the
middle and later Glacial Epoch an uplift of the
northern part of the continent and also of the northern
Atlantic basin. In the opinion of Professor
James Geikie this amounted to a vertical elevation of
three thousand feet above the present level, and resulted
in establishing a continuous land connection
between the higher latitudes of the two continents,
<i>which remained until the Post-glacial period</i>.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Dr.
Habernicht also recognizes this condition of affairs
and places it during the “old stone” age in Europe,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
which corresponds to the position assigned it by
McGee.</p>

<p>Very recently, Professor Spencer has summed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the evidence in favor of the elevation of the northern
portions of America and the north Atlantic, about
the early Pliocene times, and considers that it proves
beyond a doubt that it must have reached from 2000
to 3000 feet above the present level.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Further testimony to the existence of this land
bridge is offered by the glacial striæ on the rocks of
Shetland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and south Greenland.
These are in such directions and of such a
character that Mr. James Croll, a high authority,
maintains that they must have been produced by
<i>land ice</i>, and that the theory of a land connection between
these localities “can alone explain all the
facts.”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> A comparison of the flora and fauna in
the higher latitudes of the two continents reveals
marked identities which require some such theory to
explain them. Thus, certain species of land snails
occur both in Labrador and Europe, and the flora of
Greenland, although American in the north, is distinctly
European in the south.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Again, in certain very late Pliocene formations in
England, known as the Norwich crag and the red
crag of Suffolk, “no less than eighteen species of
American mollusca occur, only seven of which still
live on the Scandinavian coast, the remainder being
confined to North America.” In consequence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
such facts the most careful English geologists of to-day
hold that the land communication, which certainly
existed between Europe and North America in
Eocene times by way of Iceland and Greenland,
which was then a part of the American continent,
continued to exist through the Miocene and Pliocene
Epochs. This land bridge formed a barrier of separation
between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, so
that the temperature of the higher latitudes was much
milder than at present.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The evidence, therefore, is cumulative that at the
close of the last Glacial Epoch, and for an indeterminate
time previous, the comparatively shallow bed
of the North Atlantic was above water; and this was
about the time that we find men in the same stage of
culture dwelling on both its shores.</p>

<p>The attempt has often been made by geologists to
calculate the remoteness in time of the close of the
Ice Age, and of these vestiges of human occupation.
The chronometers appealed to are the erosion of
river valleys, especially of the gorge of Niagara, the
filling of lake beds, the accumulation of modern
detritus, etc. Professor Frederick Wright, who has
studied the problem of the Niagara gorge with especial
care, considers that a minimum period of
twelve thousand years must have elapsed since its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
erosion began.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But as Professor Gilbert justly remarks,
whatever the age of the great cataract may
be, the antiquity of man in America is far greater,
and reaches into a past for which we have found no
time-measure.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The same may be said for Europe. De Quatrefages
and many other students of the subject consider
that the evidence is sufficient to establish the presence
of man near the Atlantic coast in the Pliocene
Epoch; and excellent English geologists have claimed
that the caves in the valley of the River Clwyd, in
north Wales, whose floors contain flint implements,
had their entrance blocked by true glacial deposits,
so that man was there present before the Great Ice
Age began.</p>

<p>From this brief presentation of the geologic evidence,
the conclusion seems forced upon us that the
ancestors of the American race could have come from
no other quarter than western Europe, or that portion
of Eurafrica which in my lectures on general
ethnography I have described as the most probable
location of the birth-place of the species.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Many difficulties present themselves in bringing

<p>Of course it would not be correct to suppose that
the earliest inhabitants of the continent presented the
physical traits which mark the race to-day. Racial
peculiarities are slowly developed in certain “areas
of characterization,” but once fixed are indelible.
Can we discover the whereabouts of the area which
impressed upon primitive American man&mdash;an immigrant,
as we have learned, from another hemisphere&mdash;those
corporeal changes which set him over against his
fellows as an independent race?</p>

<p>I believe that it was in the north temperate zone.
It is there we find the oldest signs of man’s residence
on the continent; it is and was geographically the
nearest to the land-areas of the Old World; and so
far as we can trace the lines of the most ancient migrations,
they diverged from that region. But there
are reasons stronger than these. The American Indians
cannot bear the heat of the tropics even as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
as the European, not to speak of the African race.
They perspire little, their skin becomes hot, and
they are easily prostrated by exertion in an elevated
temperature. They are peculiarly subject to diseases
of hot climates, as hepatic disorders, showing none
of the immunity of the African.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Furthermore, the
finest physical specimens of the race are found in the
colder regions of the temperate zones, the Pampas
and Patagonian Indians in the south, the Iroquois
and Algonkins in the north; whereas, in the tropics
they are generally undersized, short-lived, of inferior
muscular force and with slight tolerance of disease.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>These facts, taken in connection with the geologic
events I have already described, would lead us to
place the “area of characterization” of the native
American east of the Rocky Mountains, and between
the receding wall of the continental ice sheet and the
Gulf of Mexico. There it was that the primitive
glacial man underwent those changes which resulted in
the formation of an independent race.</p>

<p>We have evidence that this change took place at
a very remote epoch. The Swiss anatomist, Dr. J.
Kollmann, has published a critical investigation of
the most ancient skulls discovered in America, as the
one I have already referred to from Calaveras county,
California, one from Rock Bluff, Illinois, one from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Pontimelo, Buenos Ayres, and others from the caverns
of Lagoa Santa, Brazil, and from the loess of the
Pampas. All these are credited with an antiquity going
back nearly to the close of the last glacial period,
and are the oldest yet found on the continent. They
prove to be strictly analogous to those of the Indians
of the present day. They reveal the same discrepancy
in form which we now encounter in the crania of all
American tribes. The Calaveras skull and that from
Pontimelo are brachycephalic; those from Lagoa
Santa dolichocephalic; but both possess the wide
malar arches, the low orbital indices, the medium
nasal apertures and the general broad faces of the
present population. Dr. Kollmann, therefore, reaches
the conclusion that “the variety of man in America
at the close of the glacial period had the same facial
form as the Indian of to-day, and the racial traits
which distinguish him now, did also at that time.”</p>

<p>The marked diversity in cranial forms here indicated
is recognizable in all parts of the continent. It
has frustrated every attempt to classify the existing
tribes, or to trace former lines of migration, by
grouping together similar head-measurements. This
was fully acknowledged by the late Dr. James Aitken
Meigs, of Philadelphia, who, taking the same collection
of skulls, showed how erroneous were the previous
statements of Dr. Morton in his <i>Crania Americana</i>.
The recent studies of Virchow on American
crania have attained the same conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> We must
dismiss as wholly untenable the contrary arguments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of the French and other craniologists, and still more
peremptorily those attempted identifications of American
skulls with “Mongolian” or “Mongoloid” types.
Such comparisons are based on local peculiarities
which have no racial value.</p>

<p>Yet it must not be supposed from this that carefully
conducted cranial comparisons between tribes and
families are valueless; on the contrary, the shape and
size of the skull, the proportion of the face, and
many other measurements, are in the average highly
distinctive family traits, and I shall frequently call
attention to them.</p>

<p>The lowest cephalic index which I have seen reported
from an American skull is 56, which is that of
a perforated skull from Devil river, Michigan, now
in the medical museum at Ann Arbor university;<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
the highest is 97, from a Peruvian skull, though
probably this was the result of an artificial deformity.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to conclude from these or other
diversities in skull forms that the American race is a
conglomerate of other and varied stocks. As I have
pointed out elsewhere, the shape of the skull is not a
fixed element in human anatomy, and children of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
same mother may differ in this respect.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>A special feature in American skulls is the presence
of the epactal bone, or <i>os Incæ</i>, in the occiput.
It is found in a complete or incomplete condition in
3.86 per cent. of the skulls throughout the continent,
and in particular localities much more frequently;
among the ancient Peruvians for example in 6.08
per cent., and among the former inhabitants of the
Gila valley in 6.81 per cent. This is far more frequently
than in other races, the highest being the
negro, which offers 2.65 per cent., while the Europeans
yield but 1.19.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The presence of the bone is
due to a persistence of the transverse occipital suture,
which is usually closed in fetal life. Hence it is a
sign of arrested development, and indicative of an
inferior race.</p>

<p>The majority of the Americans have a tendency to
meso- or brachycephaly, but in certain families, as the
Eskimos in the extreme north and the Tapuyas in
Brazil, the skulls are usually decidedly long. In
other instances there is a remarkable difference in
members of the same tribe and even of the same
household. Thus among the Yumas there are some
with as low an index as 68, while the majority are
above 80, and among the dolichocephalic Eskimos
we occasionally find an almost globular skull. So
far as can be learned, these variations appear in persons
of pure blood. Often the crania differ in no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
wise from those of the European. Dr. Hensell, for
instance, says that the skulls of pure-blood Coroados
of Brazil, which he examined, corresponded in all
points to those of the average German.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The average cubical capacity of the American
skull falls below that of the white, and rises above
that of the black race. Taking both sexes, the
Parisians of to-day have a cranial capacity of 1448
cubic centimetres; the Negroes 1344 c. c.; the American
Indians 1376.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> But single examples of Indian
skulls have yielded the extraordinary capacity of
1747, 1825, and even 1920 cub. cent. which are not
exceeded in any other race.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The hue of the skin is generally said to be reddish,
or coppery, or cinnamon color, or burnt coffee color.
It is brown of various shades, with an undertone of
red. Individuals or tribes vary from the prevailing
hue, but not with reference to climate. The
Kolosch of the northwest coast are very light colored;
but not more so than the Yurucares of the Bolivian
Andes. The darkest are far from black, and
the lightest by no means white.</p>

<p>The hair is rarely wholly black, as when examined
by reflected light it will also show a faint undercolor
of red. This reddish tinge is very perceptible in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
some tribes, and especially in children. Generally
straight and coarse, instances are not wanting where
it is fine and silky, and even slightly wavy or curly.
Although often compared to that of the Chinese, the
resemblances are superficial, as when critically examined,
“the hair of the American Indian differs in
nearly every particular from that of the Mongolians
of eastern Asia.”<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The growth is thick and strong
on the head, scanty on the body and on the face;
but beards of respectable length are not wholly unknown.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The stature and muscular force vary. The Patagonians
have long been celebrated as giants, although
in fact there are not many of them over six feet tall.
The average throughout the continent would probably
be less than that of the European. But there
are no instances of dwarfish size to compare with the
Lapps, the Bushmen, or the Andaman Islanders. The
hands and feet are uniformly smaller than those of
Europeans of the same height. The arms are longer
in proportion to the other members than in the European,
but not so much as in the African race. This
is held to be one of the anatomical evidences of inferiority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole, the race is singularly uniform in its
physical traits, and individuals taken from any part
of the continent could easily be mistaken for inhabitants
of numerous other parts.</p>

<p>This uniformity finds one of its explanations in
the geographical features of the continent, which
are such as to favor migrations in longitude, and
thus prevent the diversity which special conditions
in latitude tend to produce. The trend of the mountain
chains and the flow of the great rivers in both
South and North America generally follow the course
of the great circles, and the migrations of native nations
were directed by these geographic features.
Nor has the face of the land undergone any serious
alteration since man first occupied it. Doubtless in
his early days the Laramie sea still covered the extensive
depression in that part of our country, and it
is possible that a subsidence of several hundred feet
altered the present Isthmus of Panama into a chain
of islands; but in other respects the continent between
the fortieth parallels north and south has remained
substantially the same since the close of the
Tertiary Epoch.</p>

<p>Beyond all other criteria of a race must rank its
mental endowments. These are what decide irrevocably
its place in history and its destiny in time.
Some who have personally studied the American
race are inclined to assign its psychical potentialities
a high rank. For instance, Mr. Horatio Hale hesitates
not to say: “Impartial investigation and comparison
will probably show that while some of the
aboriginal communities of the American continent
are low in the scale of intellect, others are equal in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
natural capacity, and possibly superior, to the highest
of the Indo-European race.”<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This may be regarded
as an extremely favorable estimate. Few will
assent to it, and probably not many would even go
so far as Dr. Amedée Moure in his appreciation of
the South American Indians, which he expresses in
these words: “With reference to his mental powers,
the Indian of South America should be classed immediately
after the white race, decidedly ahead of
the yellow race, and especially beyond the African.”<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Such general opinions are interesting because both
of them are the results of personal observations of
many tribes. But the final decision as to the abilities
of a race or of an individual must be based on actual
accomplished results, not on supposed endowments.
Thus appraised, the American race certainly stands
higher than the Australian, the Polynesian or the
African, but does not equal the Asian.</p>

<p>A review of the evidence bears out this opinion.
Take the central social fact of government. In ancient
America there are examples of firm and stable
states, extending their sway widely and directed by
definite policy. The league of the Iroquois was a
thoroughly statesman-like creation, and the realm of
Peru had a long and successful existence. That this
mental quality is real is shown by the recent history
of some of the Spanish-American republics. Two of
them, Guatemala and Mexico, count among their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
ablest presidents in the present generation pure-blood
American Indians.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Or we may take up the arts.
In architecture nothing ever accomplished by the
Africans or Polynesians approaches the pre-Columbian
edifices of the American continent. In the development
of artistic forms, whether in stone, clay or
wood, the American stands next to the white race.
I know no product of Japanese, Chinese or Dravidian
sculpture, for example, which exhibits the human
face in greater dignity than the head in basalt figured
by Humboldt as an Aztec priestess.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The invention
of a phonetic system for recording ideas was
reached in Mexico, and is striking testimony to the
ability of the natives. In religious philosophy there
is ample evidence that the notion of a single incorporeal
Ruler of the universe had become familiar both
to Tezcucans and Kechuas previous to the conquest.</p>

<p>While these facts bear testimony to a good natural
capacity, it is also true that the receptivity of the race
for a foreign civilization is not great. Even individual
instances of highly educated Indians are rare;
and I do not recall any who have achieved distinction
in art or science, or large wealth in the business
world.</p>

<p>The culture of the native Americans strongly attests
the ethnic unity of the race. This applies
equally to the ruins and relics of its vanished nations,
as to the institutions of existing tribes. Nowhere do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
we find any trace of foreign influence or instruction,
nowhere any arts or social systems to explain which
we must evoke the aid of teachers from the eastern
hemisphere. The culture of the American race, in
whatever degree they possessed it, was an indigenous
growth, wholly self-developed, owing none of its
germs to any other race, ear-marked with the psychology
of the stock.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this culture was not, as is usually
supposed, monopolized by a few nations of the race.
The distinction that has been set up by so many ethnographers
between “wild tribes” and “civilized
tribes,” <i>Jägervölker</i> and <i>Culturvölker</i>, is an artificial
one, and conveys a false idea of the facts. There was
no such sharp line. Different bands of the same
linguistic stock were found, some on the highest,
others on the lowest stages of development, as is strikingly
exemplified in the Uto-Aztecan family. Wherever
there was a center of civilization, that is, wherever
the surroundings favored the development of
culture, tribes of different stocks enjoyed it to nearly
an equal degree, as in central Mexico and Peru. By
them it was distributed, and thus shaded off in all
directions.</p>

<p>When closely analyzed, the difference between the
highest and the average culture of the race is much
less than has been usually taught. The Aztecs of
Mexico and the Algonkins of the eastern United
States were not far apart, if we overlook the objective
art of architecture and one or two inventions.
To contrast the one as a wild or savage with the
other as a civilized people, is to assume a false point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of view and to overlook their substantial psychical
equality.</p>

<p>For these reasons American culture, wherever examined,
presents a family likeness which the more
careful observers of late years have taken pains to
put in a strong light. This was accomplished for
governmental institutions and domestic architecture
by Lewis H. Morgan, for property rights and the laws
of war by A. F. Bandelier, for the social condition of
Mexico and Peru by Dr. Gustav Brühl, and I may add
for the myths and other expressions of the religious
sentiment by myself.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>In certain directions doubtless the tendency has
been to push this uniformity too far, especially with
reference to governmental institutions. Mr. Morgan’s
assertions upon this subject were too sweeping.
Nevertheless he was the first to point out clearly that
ancient American society was founded, not upon the
family, but upon the gens, totem or clan, as the social
unit.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The gens is “an organized body of consanguineal
kindred” (Powell), either such in reality, or,
when strangers have been adopted, so considered by
the tribal conscience. Its members dwell together in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
one house or quarter, and are obliged to assist each
other. An indeterminate number of these gentes,
make up the tribe, and smaller groups of several of
them may form “phratries,” or brotherhoods, usually
for some religious purpose. Each gens is to a large
extent autonomic, electing its own chieftain, and deciding
on all questions of property and especially of
blood-revenge, within its own limits. The tribe is
governed by a council, the members of which belong
to and represent the various gentes. The tribal chief
is elected by this council, and can be deposed at its
will. His power is strictly limited by the vote of the
council, and is confined to affairs of peace. For war,
a “war chief” is elected also by the council, who
takes sole command. Marriage within the gens is
strictly prohibited, and descent is traced and property
descends in the female line only.</p>

<p>This is the ideal theory of the American tribal organization,
and we may recognize its outlines almost
anywhere on the continent; but scarcely anywhere
shall we find it perfectly carried out. The gentile
system is by no means universal, as I shall have occasion
to point out; where it exists, it is often traced in
the male line; both property and dignities may be inherited
directly from the father; consanguine marriage,
even that of brother and sister or father and
daughter, though rare, is far from unexampled.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> In
fact, no one element of the system was uniformly respected,
and it is an error of theorists to try to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
it appear so. It varied widely in the same stock and
in all its expressions.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> This is markedly true, for
instance, in domestic architecture. The Lenâpé, who
were next neighbors to the Five Nations, had nothing
resembling their “long house,” on which Morgan
founded his scheme of communal tenements; and
the efforts which some later writers have made to
identify the large architectural works of Mexico and
Yucatan with the communal pueblos of the Gila valley
will not bear the test of criticism.</p>

<p>The foundation of the gentile, as of any other
family life, is, as I have shown elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the mutual
affection between kindred. In the primitive
period this is especially between the children of the
same mother, not so much because of the doubt of
paternity as because physiologically and obviously it
is the mother in whom is formed and from whom
alone proceeds the living being. Why this affection
does not lead to the marriage of uterine brothers and
sisters&mdash;why, on the contrary, there is almost everywhere
a horror of such unions&mdash;it is not easy to explain.
Darwin suggests that the chief stimulus to
the sexual feelings is novelty, and that the familiarity
of the same household breeds indifference; and we
may accept this in default of a completer explanation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Certainly, as Moritz Wagner has forcibly
shown,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> this repugnance to incest is widespread in
the species, and has exerted a powerful influence on
its physical history.</p>

<p>In America marriage was usually by purchase, and
was polygamous. In a number of tribes the purchase
of the eldest daughter gave the man a right to
buy all the younger daughters, as they reached nubile
age. The selection of a wife was often regarded as the
concern of the gens rather than of the individual.
Among the Hurons, for instance, the old women of
the gens selected the wives for the young men, “and
united them with painful uniformity to women several
years their senior.”<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Some control in this direction
was very usual, and was necessary to prevent
consanguine unions.</p>

<p>The position of women in the social scheme of the
American tribes has often been portrayed in darker
colors than the truth admits. As in one sense a
chattel, she had few rights against her husband; but
some she had, and as they were those of her gens,
these he was forced to respect. Where maternal descent
prevailed, it was she who owned the property
of the pair, and could control it as she listed. It
passed at her death to her blood relatives and not to
his. Her children looked upon her as their parent,
but esteemed their father as no relation whatever.
An unusually kind and intelligent Kolosch Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was chided by a missionary for allowing his father to
suffer for food. “Let him go to his own people,”
replied the Kolosch, “they should look after him.”
He did not regard a man as in any way related or
bound to his paternal parent.</p>

<p>The women thus made good for themselves the
power of property, and this could not but compel
respect. Their lives were rated at equal or greater
value than a man’s;<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> instances are frequent where
their voice was important in the council of the tribe;
nor was it very rare to see them attaining the dignity
of head chief. That their life was toilsome is true;
but its dangers were less, and its fatigues scarce
greater, than that of their husbands. Nor was it
more onerous than that of the peasant women of
Europe to-day.</p>

<p>Such domestic arrangements seem strange to us,
but they did not exclude either conjugal or parental
affection. On the contrary, the presence of such sentiments
has impressed travelers among even the
rudest tribes, as the Eskimos, the Yumas and the
hordes of the Chaco;<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and Miss Alice Fletcher tells me
she has constantly noted such traits in her studies of
life in the wigwam. The husband and father will
often undergo severe privations for his wife and children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The error to which I have referred of classifying
the natives into wild and civilized tribes has led to
regarding the one as agricultural, and the other as
depending exclusively on hunting and fishing. Such
was not the case. The Americans were inclined to
agriculture in nearly all regions where it was profitable.
Maize was cultivated both north and south to
the geographical extent of its productive culture;
beans, squashes, pumpkins, and potatoes were assiduously
planted in suitable latitudes; the banana was
rapidly accepted after its introduction, even by tribes
who had never seen a white man; cotton for clothing
and tobacco as a luxury were staple crops among very
diverse stocks. The Iroquois, Algonkins and Muskokis
of the Atlantic coast tilled large fields, and
depended upon their harvests for the winter supplies.
The difference between them and the sedentary Mexicans
or Mayas in this respect was not so wide as has
been represented.</p>

<p>It was a serious misfortune for the Americans that
the fauna of the continent did not offer any animal
which could be domesticated for a beast of draft or
burden. There is no doubt but that the horse existed
on the continent contemporaneously with post-glacial
man; and some palæontologists are of opinion
that the European and Asian horses were descendants
of the American species;<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> but for some mysterious
reason the genus became extinct in the New World
many generations before its discovery. The dog, domesticated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
from various species of the wolf, was a poor
substitute. He aided somewhat in hunting, and in
the north as an animal of draft; but was of little
general utility. The lama in the Cordilleras in South
America was prized principally for his hair, and was
also utilized for burdens, but not for draft.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Nor
were there any animals which could be domesticated
for food or milk. The buffalo is hopelessly wild, and
the peccary, or American hog, is irreclaimable in its
love of freedom.</p>

<p>We may say that America everywhere at the time
of the discovery was in the polished stone age. It
had progressed beyond the rough stone stage, but
had not reached that of metals. True that copper,
bronze and the precious ores were widely employed
for a variety of purposes; but flaked and polished
stone remained in all parts the principal material
selected to produce a cutting edge. Probably three-fourths
of the tribes were acquainted with the art of
tempering and moulding clay into utensils or figures;
but the potter’s wheel and the process of glazing had
not been invented. Towns and buildings were laid
out with a correct eye, and stone structures of symmetry
were erected; but the square, the compass, the
plumb line, and the scales and weight had not been
devised.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Commodious boats of hollowed logs or of
bark, or of skins stretched on frames, were in use on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
most of the waters; but the inventive faculties of their
makers had not reached to either oars or sails to propel
them,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the paddle alone being relied upon, and
the rudder to guide them was unknown. The love
of music is strong in the race, and wind instruments
and those sounded by percussion had been devised
in considerable variety; but the highest type, the
string instruments, were beyond their capacity of
invention.</p>

<p>The religious sentiment was awake in all the tribes
of the continent, and even the lowest had myths and
propitiatory rites by which to explain to themselves
and cajole to their own interests the unknown powers
which order the destiny of human life. There is a
singular similarity in these myths. The leading
cycle of them usually describes the exploits of a divine
man, the national hero-god, who was the first
instructor, often the ancestor of the tribe, and the
creator of the visible universe. His later history is
related with singular parallelism by tribes in Canada
and Mexico, in Yucatan and Uruguay. After teaching
his people the arts of life and the sacred rites, the
forms of their social organizations and the medicinal
powers of plants, he left in some mysterious way,
not by the event of death, but for a journey, or by
rising to the sky; leaving with them, however, his
promise to return at some future day, when they
should need him, and he should again become their
guide and protector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The interpretation of this fundamental American
myth, which I have shown to be the typical religious
legend of the race,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> offers an interesting problem.
Comparing it with others of similar form in Egyptian
and Aryac antiquity, I have explained it as based on
the natural phenomenon of the returning and departing
day, as, if not a solar, at least a light myth, developed
through personification and etymologic processes.
Often the hero-god is identified with some
animal, as the raven, the rabbit, the wolf or coyote,
the jaguar, the toucan, etc. Possibly in these we
may recognize the “totemic animal” after which the
gens was named; but in most cases the identification
cannot be made.</p>

<p>The hero-god is usually connected with tales of a
creation and a flood, or other destruction of the world.
These cosmogonical and cataclysmal myths belong
together, and arise from the same impulse to explain
cosmic phenomena by the analogy with ordinary
changes of the seasons and the day. In constant
connection with them, and also with the rites of religion
and medicine, with the social institutions and
the calendar, with the plans of edifices and the arrangement
of gens and phratries, in fact, with all the
apparatus of life, was a respect for the <i>sacred number</i>.
It is strange how constantly this presents itself
throughout American life, and is, in fact, the key to
many of its forms. The sacred number is Four, and
its origin is from the four cardinal points. These
were the guides to the native in his wanderings, and,
as identified with the winds, were the deities who
brought about the change of the seasons and the phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of the weather. They were represented by
the symbols of the cross, whose four arms we see portrayed
on the altar tablet of Palenque, on the robes
of the Mexican priests, in the hieroglyphs of the
Algonkins, and in countless other connections.</p>

<p>A rich symbolism rapidly developed in all the
sedentary tribes, and very much along the same lines.
The bird, the serpent, the sacred stone, the tree of
life, water as a purifier, the perpetual fire, all these
are members of a religious symbolism, clear signs of
which recur in all segments of the continent. The
chants and dances, the ritual of the medicine men,
the functions of esoteric orders and secret societies,
present a resemblance greater than that which can be
explained by a mere similarity in the stage of culture.
I explain it by the ethnic and psychical unity of the
race, and its perpetual freedom from any foreign influence.</p>

<p>The mortuary rites indicated a belief in the continued
existence of the individual after apparent
death. These were by incineration, by inhumation,
by exposure, or by mummification. Articles were
placed with the deceased for use in his future state,
and the ceremonies of mourning were frequently
severe and protracted. A sacredness was generally
attached to the bones and therefore these were carefully
preserved. In accordance with a superstition
widely felt in the Old World, they were supposed to
harbor some share of the departed spirit. The conception
of the after life is wholly material. The
Zapotec, for instance, believes that he will return to
his familiar haunts after a few hundred years, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
buries all the money he makes that he may then live
at his ease. Von Gagern estimates the amount of
silver thus secreted and lost within the last century at
a hundred million dollars.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The ceremonies of religion, which included that of
the treatment of disease, inasmuch as a demonic
cause was always assigned to illness, were in the
hands of a particular class, known to the whites as
“medicine men,” or shamans, or sorcerers. Sometimes
the right of belonging to this order was hereditary
in a gens, but generally peculiar aptitude for the
business was the only requirement. Many of them
were skilled in legerdemain, and even to-day some of
their tricks puzzle the acutest white observers. As
doctors, augurs, rain-makers, spell-binders, leaders
of secret societies, and depositaries of the tribal traditions
and wisdom, their influence was generally powerful.
Of course it was adverse to the Europeans,
especially the missionaries, and also of course it was
generally directed to their own interest or that of
their class; but this is equally true of priestly power
wherever it gains the ascendency, and the injurious
effect of the Indian shamans on their nations was not
greater than has been in many instances that of the
Christian priesthood on European communities.</p>

<p>The psychic identity of the Americans is well
illustrated in their languages. There are indeed indefinite
discrepancies in their lexicography and in
their surface morphology; but in their logical substructure,
in what Wilhelm von Humboldt called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
“inner form,” they are strikingly alike. The points
in which this is especially apparent are in the development
of pronominal forms, in the abundance of generic
particles, in the overweening preference for
concepts of action (verbs), rather than concepts of
existence (nouns), and in the consequent subordination
of the latter to the former in the proposition.
This last mentioned trait is the source of that characteristic
which is called <i>incorporation</i>. The American
languages as a rule are essentially incorporative
languages, that is, they formally include both subject
and object in the transitive concept, and its oral
expression. It has been denied by some able linguists
that this is a characteristic trait of American
languages; but I have yet to find one, of which we
possess ample means of analysis, in which it does not
appear in one or another of its forms, thus revealing
the same linguistic impulse. Those who reject it as
a feature have been led astray either by insufficient
means of information about certain languages, or by
not clearly comprehending the characteristics of the
incorporative process itself.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>As intimated, however, in spite of this underlying
sameness, there is wide diversity in the tongues themselves.
Where we cannot find sufficient coincidences
of words and grammar in two languages to admit of
supposing that under the laws of linguistic science
they are related, they are classed as independent
stocks or families. Of such there are about eighty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
North and as many in South America. These stocks
offer us, without doubt, our best basis for the ethnic
classification of the American tribes; the only basis,
indeed, which is of any value. The efforts which
have been heretofore made to erect a geographic classification,
with reference to certain areas, political or
physical; or a craniological one, with reference to
skull forms; or a cultural one, with reference to
stages of savagery and civilization, have all proved
worthless. The linguistic is the only basis on which
the subdivision of the race should proceed. Similarity
of idioms proves to some extent similarity of descent
and similarity of psychic endowments. Of course,
there has been large imposition of one language on
another in the world’s history; but never without a
corresponding infiltration of blood; so that the
changes in language remain as evidence of national
and race comminglings. I select, therefore, the linguistic
classification of the American race as the only
one of any scientific value, and, therefore, that which
alone merits consideration.</p>

<p>The precise number of linguistic stocks in use in
America at the discovery has not been made out. In
that portion of the continent north of Mexico the researches
of the Bureau of Ethnology of the United
States have defined fifty-nine stocks, no less than
forty of which were confined to the narrow strip of
land between the Rocky mountains and the Pacific
ocean.</p>

<p>For convenience of study I shall classify all the
stocks into five groups, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<table summary="The groups into which Brinton classifies the linguistic stocks">
  <tr>
    <td class="right">I.</td>
    <td>The North Atlantic Group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="right">II.</td>
    <td>The North Pacific Group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="right">III.</td>
    <td>The Central Group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="right">IV.</td>
    <td>The South Pacific Group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="right">V.</td>
    <td>The South Atlantic Group.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This arrangement is not one of convenience only;
I attach a certain ethnographic importance to this
classification. There is a distinct resemblance between
the two Atlantic groups, and an equally distinct
contrast between them and the Pacific groups, extending
to temperament, culture and physical traits.
Each of the groups has mingled extensively within
its own limits, and but slightly outside of them.
Each is subject to conditions of temperature, altitude
and humidity, which are peculiar to itself, and which
have exerted definite influences on the constitution
and the history of its inhabitants. Such a subdivision
of the race is therefore justified by anthropologic
considerations.</p>

<h2 id="NORTH_AMERICAN_TRIBES">NORTH AMERICAN TRIBES.</h2>

<h3 id="I_THE_NORTH_ATLANTIC_GROUP">I. THE NORTH ATLANTIC GROUP.</h3>

<h4>1. THE ESKIMOS.</h4>

<p>The word Eskimo, properly <i>Eski-mwhan</i>, means
in the Abnaki dialect of Algonquin, “he eats
raw flesh,” and was applied to the tribe from its custom
of consuming fish and game without cooking.
They call themselves <i>Innuit</i>, “people,” a term the
equivalent of which is the usual expression applied
by American natives to their own particular stock.</p>

<p>The Innuit are at present essentially a maritime
and arctic nation, occupying the coast and adjacent
islands from the Straits of Belle Isle on the Atlantic
to Icy Bay, at the foot of Mount St. Elias on the
Pacific, and extending their wanderings and settlements
as far up Smith’s Sound as N. Lat. 80°, where
they are by far the northernmost inhabitants of the
earth. They have occupied Greenland for certainly
more than a thousand years, and were the earliest
settlers in some of the Aleutian islands. Portions of
them at some remote period crossed Behring Strait and
settled on Asiatic soil, while others established themselves
along the shores of Newfoundland. Indeed,
from the reports of the early Norse explorers and
from the character of relics found on the Atlantic
coast, it is probable that they once extended as far
south as the mouth of the Delaware river.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
ancestors quite possibly dwelt on the moors of New
England when the reindeer browsed there, and accompanied
that quadruped in his final migration to
the north. They belong in history and character to
the Atlantic peoples.</p>

<p>This question, as to where their common progenitors
resided, has been much discussed. A favorite
theory of some writers has been that they migrated
out of Asia by way of Behring Strait; but those who
have studied their culture on the spot do not advocate
this opinion. These observers have, without exception,
reached the conclusion that the Innuit were originally
an inland people, that their migrations were
toward the north and west, and that they have been
gradually forced to the inhospitable climes they occupy
by the pressure of foes. Dr. Rink, who passed
many years among them, would look for their early
home somewhere in Alaska; but Mr. John Murdoch
and Dr. Franz Boas, two of our best authorities on
this tribe, incline to the view that their primal home
was to the south of Hudson Bay, whence they separated
into three principal hordes, the one passing into
Labrador and reaching Greenland, the second moving
to the coast of the Arctic sea, and the third to
Alaska. These form respectively the Greenland,
the Chiglit and the Kadjak dialects of the common
tongue.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The closest observers report the physical traits of
the Eskimos as thoroughly American and not Asian,
as has sometimes been alleged.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> In appearance the
Innuits of pure blood are of medium or slightly undersize,
color dark, nose prominent and sometimes
aquiline, hair dark brown or black, moderately
strong on the face, the pubes and in the axilla;
the eyes are dark brown and occasionally blue. The
skull is generally long (dolichocephalic), but is subject
to extensive variations ranging from almost
globular to exceptionally long and narrow specimens.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the hardships of their life, the Innuits
are of a singularly placid and cheerful temperament,
good-natured among themselves and much given to
mirth and laughter.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The ingenuity with which
they have learned to overcome the difficulties of their
situation is quite surprising. In a country without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
wood or water, frightfully cold, and yielding no manner
of edible fruit or vegetable, they manage to live
and thrive. Their principal nurriture is the product
of the sea. They build boats called <i>kayaks</i> or
<i>bidarkas</i> from the bones of walrus covered with the
skins of seals; their winter houses are of blocks of
snow laid up on the principle of the circular arch to
form a dome, with windows of sheets of ice. These
they warm by means of stone lamps fed with blubber
oil. Their clothing is of bird skins and furs, and they
are skilled in the preparation of a sort of leather. As
faithful companions they have their dogs, intelligent
animals, used both in hunting and for drawing small
sledges built of wood or bone.</p>

<p>With their tools of bone or stone they fashion many
curious and useful articles, displaying a marked inventive
faculty and an artistic eye. The picture-writing
which they devised for the assistance of their
memory is greatly superior to any found north of
Mexico in the faithful delineation of objects, especially
of animal forms.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The long winter nights are enlivened by music and
songs, of which they are passionately fond, and by
the recital of imaginative tales, the stock of which is
inexhaustible. A skillful bard enjoys a wide reputation,
and some of their poems contain fine and delicate
sentiments.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Others are from ancient date, and are
passed down from generation to generation with scrupulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
fidelity, every tone, every gesture, being imitated.
The meter and rendition of their songs seem
to the European monotonous, but the Eskimo has
his own notion of the music of verse, and it is a very
advanced one; he would have it akin to the sweet
sounds of nature, and for that reason their poets sleep
by the sound of running water that they may catch
its mysterious notes, and model on them their own
productions.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> These songs also serve as a peaceful
means to allay feuds. When two persons quarrel,
they will appoint an evening and sing “nith songs”
at each other, and the audience will decide which
comes out best. This verdict will put an end to the
ill-feeling.</p>

<p>The imaginative character of the people is also
reflected in their religions. They believe in one or
several overruling powers, and in a multitude of inferior
spirits and uncanny monsters. These require
propitiation rather than worship. The general belief
is that a person has two souls, one of which is inseparably
connected with his name and passes with it
to any infant named for him; while the second either
descends to a warm and pleasant abode under the
earth or passes to a less agreeable one in the sky; the
streaming lights of the aurora borealis were sometimes
thought to be these latter spirits in their celestial
home.</p>

<p>The rites of their religion were performed chiefly
by the priests, called <i>angekoks</i>, who, however, were
little better than conjurers. In some parts this office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was hereditary.</p>

<p>The language of the Innuits is very much the same
throughout the whole of their extended domain.
Bishop de Schweinitz once told me that a few years
ago a convert from the Moravian mission in Labrador
went to Alaska, and it required but a few weeks
for him to understand and be understood by the natives
there. In character the tongue is highly agglutinative,
the affixes being joined to the end of the
word. The verb is very complex, having thirty-one
hundred modified forms, all different and all invariable.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
It is rich in expressions for all the objects
of Eskimo life, and is harmonious to the ear. Like
the Greek, it has three numbers, singular, dual and
plural.</p>

<p>Those Eskimos who live in Asia call themselves
<i>Yuit</i>, a dialect form of Innuit. They dwell around
East Cape and the shore south of it, in immediate
contact with the Namollos or Sedentary Chukchis, a
Sibiric people, totally different in language, appearance
and culture. The Yuits have not at all assimilated
to the reindeer-keeping, pastoral habits of the
Chukchis, and by their own well-preserved traditions,
moved across the straits from the American side, with
which they continue commercial intercourse. Their
villages are sometimes close to those of the Namollos,
or Sedentary Chukchis, they intermarry, and have a
jargon sufficient for their mutual purposes; but it is
an error, though a prevailing one, to suppose that
they are the same people. The Chukchis never entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
America, and the Innuits, as a people, never
crossed from Asia, or originated there.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The jade implements
of northeastern Siberia have proved to be of
the Alaskan variety of that stone, and not the Chinese
jade, as some supposed.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>From all points whence we have definite information,
this interesting people are steadily diminishing
in numbers, even where they are not in contact
with the whites. The immediate causes appear to be
increasing sterility and infant mortality. Two surviving
children to a marriage is about the average
productiveness, and statistics show that it requires
double this number for a population to maintain itself
even stationary.</p>

<p>The <i>Aleutian</i> branch occupies the long chain of
islands which stretch westward from the southwestern
corner of Alaska. The climate is mild, the sea
abounds in fish, and innumerable birds nest in the
rocks. We may therefore believe the navigators of
the last century, who placed the population of the
islands at 25,000 or 30,000 souls, although at present
they have sunk to about 2,000. They have the same
cheerful temperament as the Eskimos, and their grade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of culture was, when first discovered, about the same.
In their own language they call themselves <i>Unangan</i>,
people, the name Aleutes having been given them by
the Russians.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>It may be considered settled that their ancestors
populated the islands from the American and not
the Asiatic side. Not only do their own traditions
assert this,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> but it is confirmed by the oldest relics
of their culture, which is Eskimo in character, and
by their language, which is generally acknowledged
to be a derivative of the Alaskan Eskimo.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> It is
divided into two dialects, the Unalashkan and Atkan,
not very dissimilar, and is remarkable for the richness
of its verbal forms.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>In physical traits they are allied to the Eskimos,
though with rounder heads, the average of twenty-five
skulls giving an index of 80.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Early in this century
they were brought under the control of Russian
missionaries, and became partially civilized and attached
to the Greek Church. In their ancient myths
their earliest ancestor was said to have been the dog,
which animal was therefore regarded with due respect.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<h4>2. THE BEOTHUKS.</h4>

<p>Adjacent to the Labrador Eskimos and the northern
Algonkins, upon the Island of Newfoundland,
dwelt the Beothuks, or “Red Indians,” now extinct,
who in custom and language differed much from their
neighbors of the mainland. Although called “red,”
they are also said to have been unusually light in
complexion, and the term was applied to them from
their habit of smearing their bodies with a mixture of
grease and red ochre. They are further described as
of medium stature, with regular features and aquiline
noses, the hair black and the beard scanty or absent.</p>

<p>In several elements of culture they had marked
differences from the tribes of the adjacent mainland.
Their canoes were of bark or of skins stretched on
frames, and were in the shape of a crescent, so that
they required ballast to prevent them from upsetting.
The winter houses they constructed were large conical
lodges thirty or forty feet in diameter, having a frame
of light poles upon which was laid bark or skins,
generally the latter. Hunting and fishing provided
them with food, and they have left the reputation of
irreclaimable savages. They had no dogs, and the art
of pottery was unknown; yet they were not unskilled
as artisans, carving images of wood, dressing stone
for implements, and tanning deerskins for clothing.
An examination of their language discloses some words
borrowed from the Algonkin, and slight coincidences
with the Eskimo dialects, but the main body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
idiom stands alone, without affinities. Derivation
was principally if not exclusively by suffixes, and the
general morphology seems somewhat more akin to
Eskimo than Algonkin examples.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<h4>3. THE ATHABASCANS (TINNÉ).</h4>

<p>Few linguistic families on the continent can compare
in geographical distribution with that known as
the Athabascan, Chepewyan or Tinné. Of these synonyms,
I retain the first, as that adopted by Buschmann,
who proved, by his laborious researches, the
kinship of its various branches.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> These extend interruptedly
from the Arctic Sea to the borders of
Durango, in Mexico, and from Hudson Bay to the
Pacific.</p>

<p>In British America this stock lies immediately
north of the Algonkins, the dividing line running
approximately from the mouth of the Churchill river
on Hudson Bay to the mouth of the Fraser, on the
Pacific. To the north they are in contact with the
Eskimos and to the west with the tribes of the Pacific
coast. In this wide but cold and barren area they are
divided into a number of bands, without coherence,
and speaking dialects often quite unlike. The Loucheux
have reached the mouth of the Mackenzie river,
the Kuchin are along the Yukon, the Kenai on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
ocean about the peninsula that bears their name,
while the Nahaunies, Secaunies and Takullies are
among the mountains to the south. The Sarcees
lived about the southern head-waters of the Saskatchewan,
while other bands had crossed the mountains
and wandered quite to the Pacific coast, where they
appear as Umpquas near Salem, Oregon; as Tututenas
on Rogue river; and in California as Hupas, on and
about Trinity river. These are but a small fraction
of the great southern migration of this stock. The
Navajos belong to it, and the redoubted Apaches, who
extended their war parties far into Mexico, and who
were the main agents in destroying the civilization
which ages ago began to reveal fair promise in the
valleys of the Gila and its affluents, and who up to
very recent years defied alike the armies of both
Mexico and the United States. Their southern migrations
beyond the valley of the Gila probably do not
date far back, that is, much beyond the conquest.
Although the Mexican census of 1880 puts the Mexican
Apaches at ten thousand, no such number can be
located. Orozco y Berra mentions one of their
tribes in Chihuahua, which he calls Tobosos; but
Spanish authors refer to these as living in New Mexico
in 1583. The only Apache band now known to
be in Mexico are the Janos or Janeros in Chihuahua,
made up of Lipans and Mescaleros. (Henshaw.)</p>

<p>Wherever found, the members of this group present
a certain family resemblance. In appearance
they are tall and strong, the forehead low with prominent
superciliary ridges, the eyes slightly oblique,
the nose prominent but wide toward the base, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
mouth large, the hands and feet small. Their strength
and endurance are often phenomenal, but in the North
at least their longevity is slight, few living beyond
fifty. Intellectually they rank below most of their
neighbors, and nowhere do they appear as fosterers
of the germs of civilization. Where, as among the
Navajos, we find them having some repute for the
mechanical arts, it turns out that this is owing to
having captured and adopted the members of more
gifted tribes. Their temperament is inclined to be
gloomy and morose; yet in spite of their apparent
stolidity they are liable to panic terrors, to epidemic
neuroses, temporary hallucinations and manias&mdash;a
condition not at all rare among peoples of inferior
culture.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Nowhere do we find among them any form of government.
Their chiefs are chosen without formality,
either on account of their daring in war or for their
generosity in distributing presents. The office is not
hereditary, there is rarely even any war chief, their
campaigns being merely hurried raids. A singular
difference exists as to their gentile systems, and their
laws of consanguinity. Usually it is counted in the
female line only. Thus among the Takullies of the
north a son does not consider his father any relation,
but only his mother and her people. When a man
dies, all his property passes to his wife’s family. The
totems are named from animals, and as usual a wife
must be selected from another totem. This does not
stand in the way of a son being united to his father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
sister, and such a marriage is often effected for property
reasons. Among the Sarcees the respect for a
mother-in-law is so great that her son-in-law dares
not sit at a meal with her, or even touch her, without
paying a fine. Among the Navajo and Apache tribes
the son also follows the gens of the mother, while in
the Umpqua and Tutu branches in Oregon he belongs
to that of his father. In all the southern tribes the
gens is named from a place, not an animal.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Marriage
is polygamous at will, wives are obtained by
purchase, and among the Slave Indians the tie is so
lax that friends will occasionally exchange wives
as a sign of amity. Usually the position of the
woman is abject, and marital affection is practically
unknown; although it is said that the Nahaunies, a
tribe of eastern Alaska, at one time obeyed a female
chief.</p>

<p>The arts were in a primitive condition. Utensils
were of wood, horn or stone, though the Takully
women manufactured a coarse pottery, and also spun
and wove yarn from the hair of the mountain goat.
Agriculture was not practised either in the north or
south, the only exception being the Navajos and with
them the inspiration came from other stocks.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The
Kuchin of the Yukon make excellent bark canoes, and
both they and their neighbors live in skin tents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
neatly dressed hides. Many of the tribes of the far
north are improvident in both clothing and food, and
cannibalism was not at all uncommon among them.</p>

<p>The most cultured of their bands were the Navajos,
whose name is said to signify “large cornfields,”
from their extensive agriculture. When the Spaniards
first met them in 1541 they were tillers of the
soil, erected large granaries for their crops, irrigated
their fields by artificial water courses or <i>acequias</i>, and
lived in substantial dwellings, partly underground;
but they had not then learned the art of weaving the
celebrated “Navajo blankets,” that being a later acquisition
of their artisans.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>In their religions there was the belief in deified natural
forces and in magic that we find usually at their
stage of culture. The priests or shamans were regarded
with fear, and often controlled the counsels of
the tribe. One of their prevalent myths was that of
the great thunder-bird often identified with the raven.
On the Churchill river it was called <i>Idi</i>, and the
myth related that from its brooding on the primeval
waters the land was brought forth. The myth is
found too widespread to be other than genuine.
The Sarcees seem to have had some form of solar
worship, as they called the sun Our Father and the
earth Our Mother.</p>

<p>The Navajos, who have no reminiscence of their
ancestral home in the north, locate the scene of their
creation in the San Juan mountains, and its date
about seven centuries ago. Their story is that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
first human pair were formed of the meal of maize
brought by the gods from the cliff houses in the
cañons.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The Athabascan dialects are usually harsh and difficult
of enunciation. In reducing them to writing,
sixty-three characters have to be called on to render
the correct sounds.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> There is an oral literature of
songs and chants, many of which have been preserved
by the missionaries. The Hupas of California had
extended their language and forced its adoption
among the half-dozen neighboring tribes whom they
had reduced to the condition of tributaries.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<h4>4. THE ALGONKINS.</h4>

<p>The whole of the north Atlantic coast, between
Cape Fear and Cape Hatteras, was occupied at the
discovery by the Algonkin stock. Their northern
limit reached far into Labrador, where they were in
immediate contact with the Eskimos, and along the
southern shores of Hudson Bay, and its western littoral
as far north as Churchill river. In this vicinity lived
the Crees, one of the most important tribes, who retained
the language of the stock in its purest form.
West of them were the Ottawas and Chipeways,
closely allied in dialect, and owners of most of the
shores of lakes Michigan and Superior. Beyond
these again, and separated from them by tribes of
Dakota stock, were the Blackfeet, whose lands extended
to the very summit of the Rockies. South of
the St. Lawrence were the Abnakis or Eastlanders,
under which general name were included the Micmacs,
Echemins and others. The whole of the area
of New England was occupied by Algonkins, whose
near relatives were the Mohegans of the lower Hudson.
These were in place and dialect near to the
Lenâpés of the Delaware valley, and to the vagrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Shawnees; while the Nanticokes of Maryland, the
Powhatans of Virginia and the Pampticokes of the
Carolinas diverged more and more from the purity of
the original language.</p>

<p>These and many other tribes scattered over this
vast area were related, all speaking dialects manifestly
from the same source. Where their ancient
home was situated has been the subject of careful investigations,
the result of which may be said to be
that traditions, archæology and linguistic analysis
combine to point to the north and the east, in other
words, to some spot north of the St. Lawrence and
east of Lake Ontario, as the original home of the
stock.</p>

<p>The Algonkins may be taken as typical specimens
of the American race. They are fully up to the
average stature of the best developed European nations,
muscular and symmetrical. The distinguished
anthropologist Quetelet measured with great care six
members of the Chipeway tribe, and pronounced
them as equaling in all physical points the best specimens
of the Belgians.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Their skulls are generally
dolichocephalic, but not uniformly so. We have in
the collection of the Academy seventy-seven Algonkin
crania, of which fifty-three are dolichocephalic,
fourteen mesocephalic, and ten brachycephalic.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The
eyes are horizontal, the nose thin and prominent, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
malar bones well marked, the lips thin. The color
is a coppery brown, the hair black and straight,
though I have seen a slight waviness in some who
claim purity of blood. The hands and feet are small,
the voice rich and strong. Physical endurance is
very great, and under favorable circumstances the
longevity is fully up to that of any other race.</p>

<p>The totemic system prevailed among the Algonkin
tribes, with descent in the female line; but we do not
find among them the same communal life as among
the Iroquois. Only rarely do we encounter the “long
house,” occupied by a number of kindred families.
Among the Lenâpés, for example, this was entirely
unknown, each married couple having its own residence.
The gens was governed by a chief, who was
in some cases selected by the heads of the other
gentes. The tribe had as permanent ruler a “peace
chief,” selected from a particular gens, also by the
heads of the other gentes. His authority was not
absolute, and, as usual, did not extend to any matter
concerning the particular interests of any one gens.
When war broke out, the peace chief had no concern
in it, the campaign being placed in charge of a “war
chief,” who had acquired a right to the position by
his prominent prowess and skill.</p>

<p>While the Mohegans built large communal houses,
the Lenâpés and most of the eastern Algonkins constructed
small wattled huts with rounded tops,
thatched with the leaves of the Indian corn or with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
sweet flags. These were built in groups and surrounded
with palisades of stakes driven into the
ground. In summer, light brush tents took the place
of these. Agriculture was by no means neglected.
The early explorers frequently refer to large fields of
maize, squash and tobacco under cultivation by the
natives. The manufacture of pottery was widespread,
although it was heavy and coarse. Mats
woven of bark and rushes, deer skins dressed with
skill, feather garments, and utensils of wood and
stone, are mentioned by the early voyagers. Copper
was dug from veins in New Jersey and elsewhere and
hammered into ornaments, arrowheads, knives and
chisels. It was, however, treated as a stone, and the
process of smelting it was unknown. The arrow and
spear heads were preferably of quartz, jasper and
chert, while the stone axes were of diorite, hard
sandstone, and similar tough and close-grained material.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
An extensive commerce in these and similar
articles was carried on with very distant points. The
red pipe-stone was brought to the Atlantic coast from
the Coteau des Prairies, and even the black slate highly
ornamented pipes of the Haidah on Vancouver Island
have been exhumed from graves of Lenâpé Indians.</p>

<p>Nowhere else north of Mexico was the system of
picture writing developed so far as among the Algonkins,
especially by the Lenâpés and the Chipeways.
It had passed from the representative to the symbolic
stage, and was extensively employed to preserve the
national history and the rites of the secret societies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The figures were scratched or painted on pieces of
bark or slabs of wood, and as the color of the paint
was red, these were sometimes called “red sticks.”
One such, the curious <i>Walum Olum</i>, or “Red
Score,” of the Lenâpés, containing the traditional
history of the tribe, I was fortunate enough to rescue
from oblivion, and have published it with a translation.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
The contents of others relating to the history
of the Chipeways (Ojibways) have also been partly
preserved.</p>

<p>The religion of all the Algonkin tribes presented a
distinct similarity. It was based on the worship of
Light, especially in its concrete manifestations, as the
sun and fire; of the Four Winds, as typical of the
cardinal points, and as the rain bringers; and of the
Totemic Animal. Their myths were numerous, the
central figure being the national hero-god Manibozho
or Michabo, often identified with the rabbit, apparently
from a similarity in the words. He was the
beneficent sage who taught them laws and arts, who
gave them the maize and tobacco, and who on his departure
promised to return and inaugurate the Golden
Age. In other myths he is spoken of as the creator
of the visible world and the first father of the race.
Along with the rites in his worship were others directed
to the Spirits of the Winds, who bring about
the change of seasons, and to local divinities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The dead as a rule were buried, each gens having
its own cemetery. Some tribes preserved the bones
with scrupulous care, while in Virginia the bodies of
persons of importance were dried and deposited in
houses set apart for the purpose.</p>

<p>The tribe that wandered the furthest from the
primitive home of the stock were the Blackfeet, or
Sisika, which word has this signification. It is derived
from their earlier habitat in the valley of the
Red river of the north, where the soil was dark and
blackened their moccasins. Their bands include the
Blood or Kenai and the Piegan Indians. Half a century
ago they were at the head of a confederacy which
embraced these and also the Sarcee (Tinné) and the
Atsina (Caddo) nations, and numbered about thirty
thousand souls. They have an interesting mythology
and an unusual knowledge of the constellations.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The Lenâpés were an interesting tribe who occupied
the valley of the Delaware river and the area of the
present State of New Jersey. For some not very clear
reason they were looked upon by the other members
of the stock as of the most direct lineage, and were
referred to as “grandfather.” Their dialect, which
has been preserved by the Moravian Missionaries, is
harmonious in sound, but has varied markedly from
the purity of the Cree.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> It has lost, for instance, the
peculiar vowel change which throws the verb from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the definite to the indefinite form. The mythology of
the Lenâpés, which has been preserved in fragments,
presents the outlines common to the stock.</p>

<h4>5. THE IROQUOIS.</h4>

<p>When the French first explored the St. Lawrence
River, they found both its banks, in the vicinity
where the cities of Montreal and Quebec now stand,
peopled by the <i>Iroquois</i>. This tribe also occupied all
the area of New York state (except the valley of
the lower Hudson), where it was known as the Five
Nations. West of these were the Hurons and Neutral
Nation in Canada, and the Eries south of Lake
Erie, while to the south of the Five Nations, in the
valley of the Susquehanna and pushing their outposts
along the western shore of Chesapeake Bay to
the Potomac, were the Andastes and Conestogas,
called also Susquehannocks. Still further south,
about the head-waters of the Roanoke River, dwelt
the Tuscaroras, who afterwards returned north and
formed the sixth nation in the league. West of the
Apalachians, on the upper waters of the Tennessee
River, lived the Cherokees who, by their tradition,
had moved down from the upper Ohio, and who, if
they were not a branch of the same family, were affiliated
to it by many ancient ties of blood and language.
The latest investigations of the Bureau of
Ethnology result in favor of considering them a
branch, though a distant one, of the Iroquois line.</p>

<p>The stock was wholly an inland one, at no point
reaching the ocean. According to its most ancient
traditions we are justified in locating its priscan
home in the district between the lower St. Lawrence
and Hudson Bay. If we may judge from its cranial
forms, its purest representatives were toward the
east. The skulls of the Five Nations, as well as
those of the Tuscaroras and Cherokees, are distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
dolichocephalic, and much alike in other respects,
while those of the Hurons are brachycephalic.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Physically the stock is most superior, unsurpassed
by any other on the continent, and I may even say
by any other people in the world; for it stands on
record that the five companies (500 men) recruited
from the Iroquois of New York and Canada during
our civil war stood first on the list among all the recruits
of our army for height, vigor and corporeal
symmetry.</p>

<p>In intelligence also their position must be placed
among the highest. It was manifested less in their
culture than in their system of government. About
the middle of the fifteenth century the Onondaga
chief, Hiawatha, succeeded in completing the famous
league which bound together his nation with the
Mohawks, Oneidas, Senecas, and Cayugas into one
federation of offence and defence. “The system he
devised was to be not a loose and transitory league,
but a permanent government. While each nation
was to retain its own council and management of
local affairs, the general control was to be lodged in
a federal senate, composed of representatives to be
elected by each nation, holding office during good
behavior and acknowledged as ruling chiefs throughout
the whole confederacy. Still further, and more
remarkably, the federation was not to be a limited
one. It was to be indefinitely expansible. The
avowed design of its proposer was <i>to abolish war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
altogether</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Certainly this scheme was one of the most far-sighted,
and in its aim beneficent, which any statesman
has ever designed for man. With the Iroquois
it worked well. They included in the league portions
of the Neutral Nation and the Tuscaroras, and
for centuries it gave them the supremacy among all
their neighbors. The league was primarily based
upon or at least drew much of its strength from the
system of gentes; this prevailed both among the
Iroquois and Cherokees, descent being traced in the
female line. Indeed, it was from a study of the
Iroquois system that the late Mr. Morgan formed his
theory that ancient society everywhere passed
through a similar stage in attaining civilization.</p>

<p>It is consonant with their advanced sentiments
that among the Iroquois women had more than ordinary
respect. They were represented by a special
speaker in the councils of the tribe, and were authorized
to conduct negotiations looking towards making
peace with an enemy. Among the Conestogas we
have the instance of a woman being the recognized
“Queen” of the tribe. With the Wyandots, the
council of each gens was composed exclusively of
women. They alone elected the chief of the gens,
who represented its interests in the council of the
tribe.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>In sundry other respects they displayed an intelligent
activity. In many localities they were agricultural,
cultivating maize, beans and tobacco, building
large communal houses of logs, fortifying their
villages with palisades, and making excellent large
canoes of birch bark. According to traditions, which
are supported by recent archæological researches, the
Cherokees when they were upon the Kanawha and
Ohio had large fields under cultivation, and erected
mounds as sites for their houses and for burial purposes.
When first encountered in East Tennessee they constructed
long communal houses like the Five Nations,
had large fields of corn, built excellent canoes and
manufactured pottery of superior style and finish.
Although no method of recording thought had acquired
any development among the Iroquois, they
had many legends, myths and formal harangues
which they handed down with great minuteness from
generation to generation. In remembering them
they were aided by the wampum belts and strings,
which served by the arrangement and design of the
beads to fix certain facts and expressions in their
minds. One of the most remarkable of these ancient
chants has been edited with a translation and copious
notes by Horatio Hale.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The Cherokees had a similar
national song which was repeated solemnly each
year at the period of the green corn dance. Fragments
of it have been obtained quite recently.</p>

<p>The Iroquois myths refer to the struggle of the first
two brothers, the dark twin and the white, a familiar
symbolism in which we see the personification of the
light and darkness, and the struggle of day and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
night.</p>

<h4>6. THE CHAHTA-MUSKOKIS.</h4>

<p>The various nations who are classed under the
Muskoki stock occupied the broad and pleasant lowlands
stretching from the terminal hills of the Apalachian
Mountains to the Gulf of Mexico, and from
the Atlantic to the Mississippi, and even beyond that
mighty barrier. The remains of a few other stocks
in the eastern portion of this area indicate that the
Muskokis were not its original occupants, and this
was also their own opinion. Their legends referred
to the west and the northwest as the direction
whence their ancestors had wandered; and the
Choctaw legend which speaks of <i>Nani Waya</i>, the
Bending Mount, a large artificial mound in Winston
county, Mississippi, as the locality where their first
parents saw the light, is explained by another which
describes it as the scene of their separation from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Chickasaws.</p>

<p>Of the main division of the stock, the Choctaws
lived furthest west, bordering upon the Mississippi,
the Chickasaws in the centre, and the Creeks on the
Atlantic slope. The Seminoles were a branch of the
latter, who, in the last century, moved into Florida;
but it is probable that the whole of the west coast of
that peninsula was under the control of the Creeks
from the earliest period of which we have any
knowledge of it.</p>

<p>The various members of this stock presented much
diversity in appearance. The Creeks were tall and
slender, the Chickasaws short and heavy; the skulls
of both have a tendency to dolichocephaly, but with
marked exceptions, and the custom among many of
them to deform the head artificially in various ways
adds to the difficulties of the craniologist.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The
color of all is called a dark cinnamon.</p>

<p>The gentile system with descent in the female line
prevailed everywhere. The Creeks counted more
than twenty gentes, the Choctaws and Chickasaws
about twelve, united in phratries of four. In the
towns each gens lived in a quarter by itself, and
marriage within the gens was strictly prohibited.
Each had its own burying place and sepulchral
mound where the bones of the deceased were deposited
after they had been cleaned. The chief of each
town was elected for life from a certain gens, but the
office was virtually hereditary, as it passed to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
nephew on his wife’s side unless there were cogent
reasons against it. The chief, or <i>miko</i>, as he was
called, ruled with the aid of a council, and together
they appointed the “war chief,” who obtained the
post solely on the ground of merit. Instances of a
woman occupying the position of head chief were
not unknown, and seem to have been recalled with
pleasure by the tribe.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The early culture of these tribes is faithfully depicted
in the records of the campaign of Hernando
De Soto, who journeyed through their country in
1540. He found them cultivating extensive fields
of maize, beans, squashes and tobacco; dwelling in
permanent towns with well-constructed wooden edifices,
many of which were situated on high mounds
of artificial construction, and using for weapons and
utensils stone implements of great beauty of workmanship.
The descriptions of later travellers and the
antiquities still existing prove that these accounts
were not exaggerated. The early Muskokis were in
the highest culture of the stone age; nor were they
deficient wholly in metals. They obtained gold from
the uriferous sands of the Nacoochee and other
streams and many beautiful specimens of their ornaments
in it are still to be seen.</p>

<p>Their artistic development was strikingly similar
to that of the “mound-builders” who have left such
interesting remains in the Ohio valley; and there is,
to say the least, a strong probability that they are the
descendants of the constructors of those ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
works, driven to the south by the irruptions of the
wild tribes of the north.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Even in the last century
they built solid structures of beams fastened to upright
supports, plastered on the outside, and in the
interior divided into a number of rooms. The art of
picture-writing was not unknown to them, and some
years ago I published their remarkable “national
legend,” read off from its hieroglyphics painted on a
skin by their chief Chekilli in 1731.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The religious rites of the Creeks were so elaborate
that they attracted early attention, and we have quite
full accounts of them. They were connected with
the worship of the principle of fertility, the chief
celebration, called the <i>busk</i> (<i>puskita</i>, fast), being
solemnized when the young corn became edible. In
connection with this was the use of the “black
drink,” a decoction of the <i>Iris versicolor</i>, and the
maintenance of the perpetual fire. Their chief divinity
was referred to as the “master of breath” or
of life, and there was a developed symbolism of
colors, white representing peaceful and pleasant
ideas; red, those of war and danger. The few Seminoles
who still survive in the southern extremity of
the peninsula of Florida continue the ceremonies of
the green corn dance and black drink, though their
mythology in general has become deeply tinged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
half-understood Christian teachings.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<h4>7. THE CATAWBAS, YUCHIS, TIMUCUAS, NATCHEZ,
CHETIMACHAS, TONICAS, ADAIZE, ATAKAPAS, ETC.</h4>

<p>Within the horizon of the Muskoki stock were a
number of small tribes speaking languages totally
different. We may reasonably suppose them to have
been the débris of the ancient population who held
the land before the Muskokis had descended upon it
from the north and west. The <i>Catawbas</i> in the area
of North and South Carolinas were one of these, and
in former times are said to have had a wide extension.
South of them was the interesting tribe of the <i>Yuchis</i>.
When first heard of they were on both banks of the
Savannah river, but later moved to the Chatahuche.
They call themselves “Children of the Sun,” which
orb they regard as a female and their mother. Their
gentes are the same as those of the Creeks, and are
evidently borrowed from them. Descent is counted
in the female line. Women are held in honor, and
when De Soto first met them they were governed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
a queen.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Some of both these tribes still survive; but this is
not the case with the <i>Timucuas</i>, who occupied the
valley of the St. John river, Florida, and its tributaries,
and the Atlantic coast as far north as the St.
Mary river. They have been extinct for a century,
but we have preserved some doctrinal works written
in their tongue by Spanish missionaries in the seventeenth
century, so we gain an insight into their language.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
It is an independent stock.</p>

<p>Near the Choctaws were the <i>Natchez</i>, not far from
the present city of that name. An account of them
has been preserved by the early French settlers of
Louisiana. They were devoted sun-worshippers and
their chief was called “The Sun,” and regarded as
the earthly representative of the orb. They constructed
artificial mounds, upon which they erected
temples and houses, and were celebrated for their
skill in weaving fabrics from the inner bark of the
mulberry tree and for their fine pottery. In their religious
rites they maintained a perpetual fire, and
were accustomed to sacrifice captives to their gods,
and the wives of their chieftain at his death.</p>

<p>The <i>Taensas</i> were a branch of the Natchez on the
other bank of the Mississippi. Attention has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
drawn to them of late years by the attempt of a young
seminarist in France to foist upon scholars a language
of his own manufacture which he had christened
<i>Taensa</i>, and claimed to have derived from these people.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
The Natchez language contains many words
from the Muskoki dialects, but is radically dissimilar
from it.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> A few of the nation still preserve it in
Indian Territory.</p>

<p>The <i>Chetimachas</i> lived on the banks of Grand Lake
and Grand River, and were but a small tribe. They
are said to have been strictly monogamous, and to
have had female chieftains. Their chief deity was
Kut-Kähänsh, the Noon-day Sun, in whose honor
they held sacred dances at each new moon.</p>

<p>The <i>Tonicas</i> are frequently mentioned in the early
French accounts of the colony of Louisiana. They
lived in what is now Avoyelles parish, and were
staunch friends of the European immigrants. Their
language is an independent stock, and has some unusual
features in American tongues, such as a masculine
and a feminine gender of nouns and a dual in
three pronouns.</p>

<p>The <i>Adaize</i> or Atai were a small tribe who once
lived between Saline river and Natchitoche, La.
They spoke a vocalic language, differing from any
other, though including a number of Caddo words,
which was owing to their having been a member of
the Caddo confederacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Atakapas</i> had their hunting grounds about
Vermilion river and the adjacent Gulf coast. Their
name in Choctaw means “man-eaters,” both they
and their neighbors along the Texan coast having an
ugly reputation as cannibals, differing in this from
the Muskokis and their neighbors east of the Mississippi,
among whom we have no record of anthropophagy,
even of a ritual character. The later generations
of Atakapas have been peaceful and industrious.
Their language, though in the main quite
alone, presents a limited number of words evidently
from the same roots as their correspondents in the
Uto-Aztecan family.</p>

<p>The coast of Texas, between the mouths of the
Colorado and Nueces rivers, was the home of the
<i>Carankaways</i>. The Spaniards gave them a very
black character as merciless cannibals, impossible to
reduce or convert; but the French and English settlers
speak of them in better terms. In appearance
they were tall and strong, with low foreheads, hooked
noses, prominent cheek bones, tattooed skins, and
wore their black hair long and tangled. The older
writers affirm that they spoke Atakapa, and were a
branch of that tribe; but the scanty material of their
idiom which we possess seems to place them in a stock
by themselves.</p>

<p>The <i>Tonkaways</i> are a small tribe who lived in
northwest Texas, speaking a tongue without known
relationship. A curious feature of their mythology
is the deification of the wolf. They speak of this
animal as their common ancestor, and at certain
seasons hold wolf dances in his honor, at which they
dress themselves in wolf skins and howl and run in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
imitation of their mythical ancestor and patron. A
branch of them, the Arrenamuses, is said to have
dwelt considerably to the south of the main body,
near the mouth of the San Antonio river.</p>

<p>The lower Rio Grande del Norte was peopled on
both its banks by a stock which was christened by
Orozco y Berra the <i>Coahuiltecan</i>, but which Pimentel
preferred to call the Texan. The latter is too wide a
word, so I retain the former. There is not much
material for the study of its dialects, so we are left in
the dark as to the relationship of many tribes resident
in that region. They were small in size and
rich in names. Adolph Uhde gives the appellations
and locations of seventy-four, based on previous works
and personal observations.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The missionary Garcia,
in his <i>Manual of the Sacraments</i>, published in the
last century, names seventeen tribes speaking dialects
of the tongue he employs, which appears to be
a branch of the Coahuiltecan.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>It is useless to repeat the long list, the more so as
the bands were unimportant and have long since
become extinct, with a few exceptions. They were
in a savage condition, roving, and depending on
hunting and fishing. The following appear to have
been the principal members of the</p>

Soto la Marina and along the Gulf between the Rio
Panuco and the Rio Grande.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<h4>8. THE PAWNEES (CADDOES).</h4>

<p>The Pani<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> stock was scattered irregularly from the
Middle Missouri River to the Gulf of Mexico. The
Pawnees proper occupied the territory from the Niobrara
River south to the Arkansas. The Arikari
branch had separated and migrated to the north at
a comparatively recent period, while the Wichitas,
Caddoes and Huecos roamed over Eastern Louisiana
and Western Texas. The earliest traditions of all
these peoples assign their priscan home toward the
south, and the Pawnees remembered having driven
the Dakota tribes from the hunting grounds of the
Platte Basin.</p>

<p>The stock as a rule had an excellent physique,
being tall and robust, with well-proportioned features,
the lips thin and the eyes small. Longevity
however was rare, and few of either sex reached the
age of sixty. The division of the tribes was into
bands and these into totems, but the gentile system
did not prevail with much strength among them.
The chieftainship of the bands was hereditary in the
male line, and the power of the chief was almost
absolute. He was surrounded by a body of retainers
whom he supported, and who carried out his orders.
When he wished a council these messengers carried
the summons. Property as well as power passed to
the family of the male, and widows were often deprived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of everything and left in destitution. Marriage
was a strictly commercial transaction, the
woman being bought from her parents. The purchase
effected, the bridegroom had a right to espouse
all the younger sisters of his wife as they grew to
maturity, if he felt so inclined. The laxity of the
marriage rules of the stock was carried to its limit by
the Arikaris, among whom it is said fathers united
with their daughters and brothers with their sisters,
without offending the moral sense of the community.
This may have arisen after corruption by the whites.</p>

<p>Agriculture among them was more in favor than
generally on the plains. Maize, pumpkins and
squashes were cultivated, each family having its own
field two or three acres in extent. For about four
months of the year they were sedentary, dwelling in
houses built of poles and bark covered with sods,
while the remainder of the time they wandered over
their hunting grounds, carrying with them tents of
skins which were stretched on poles. The women
manufactured a rude pottery and the men implements
and weapons of wood and stone. The Arikaris were
skilled in the construction of boats of skin stretched
over wooden frames, an art they may have learned
from the Mandans.</p>

<p>The information about their religion is vague, but
it seems in some respects to have resembled that of the
Mexican nations. One of their chief divinities was
the morning star, <i>Opirikut</i>, which was supposed to
represent the deity of fertility and agriculture. At
the time of corn-planting a young girl, usually a captive,
was sacrificed to this divinity. The victim was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
bound to a stake and partly burned alive; but before
life had ceased, her breast was cut open, her heart
torn out and flung in the flames. Her flesh was then
cut into small pieces and buried in the cornfield.
This was believed to secure an abundant crop. The
similarity of the rite to that in vogue among the
Mexicans, who also worshipped the morning star as
the goddess of fertility, is interesting.</p>

<p>The dead were buried with their possessions, and
the customs of mourning continued sometimes for
years.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<h4>9. THE DAKOTAS (SIOUX).</h4>

<p>The western water-shed of the Mississippi river was
largely in the possession of the Dakota or Sioux
stock. Its various tribes extended in an unbroken
line from the Arkansas river on the south to the
Saskatchewan on the north, populating the whole of
the Missouri valley as far up as the Yellowstone.
Their principal tribes in the south were the Quapaws,
Kansas and Osages; in the central region the Poncas,
Omahas and Mandans; to the north were the Sioux,
Assiniboins and Crows; while about Green Bay on
Lake Michigan lived the Winnebagoes.</p>

<p>The opinion was formerly entertained that this
great family moved to the locations where they were
first met from some western home; but the researches
of modern students have refuted this. Mr. Dorsey
has shown by an analysis of their most ancient traditions
that they unanimously point to an eastern
origin, and that the central and southern bands did
not probably cross the Mississippi much before the
fourteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> This is singularly supported
by the discovery of Mr. Horatio Hale that the Tuteloes
of Virginia were a branch of the Dakotas; and
further, the investigations of Catlin among the Mandans
resulted in showing that this nation reached the
Missouri valley by travelling down the Ohio. They
therefore formed a part of the great easterly migration
of the North Atlantic tribes which seem to
have been going on for many centuries before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
discovery. In the extreme south, almost on the gulf
coast of Louisiana, lived some small bands of Dakotas,
known as Biloxis, Opelousas, Pascagoulas, etc.
They were long supposed to speak an independent
tongue, and only of late years has their proper position
been defined.</p>

<p>Their frames are powerful, and the warriors of the
Sioux have long enjoyed a celebrity for their hardihood
and daring. The massacre of General Custer’s
command, which they executed in 1876, was the
severest blow the army of the United States ever
experienced at the hands of the red man. With
reference to cranial form they are dolichocephalic,
sixteen out of twenty-three skulls in the collection of
the Academy<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> offering a cephalic index under 80.</p>

<p>The northern Dakotas do not seem to have had the
same system of gentes which prevailed in most of the
eastern tribes. Mr. Morgan was of the opinion that
it had existed, but had been lost; this, however, requires
further proof. There are many societies
among them, but not of the nature of clans. Their
chiefs hold their position by hereditary descent in
the male line, though among the Winnebagoes the
early traveller, Carver found the anomaly of a
woman presiding over the tribe. The central bands,
the Mandans and Minnetarees, recognized gentes
with descent in the female line; while among the
Poncas and Omahas there were also gentes, but with
descent in the male line. The condition in this respect,
of the members of this family, as also of that
of the Athabascan, seems to prove that the gentile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
system is by no means a fixed stadium of even American
ancient society, but is variable, and present or
absent as circumstances may dictate.</p>

<p>A few members of this family, notably the Mandans,
attained a respectable degree of culture, becoming
partly agricultural, and dwelling most of the
year in permanent abodes; but the majority of them
preferred depending on the bounties of nature, pursuing
the herds of buffaloes over the boundless pastures
of the plains, or snaring the abundant fish in
the myriad streams which traversed their country.</p>

<p>The mythology of the Dakotas is concerned with
the doings of giants in whom we recognize personifications
of the winds and storms. One of these is
Haokah, to whom the warrior sends up an invocation
when about to undertake some perilous exploit.
The thunder is caused by huge birds who flap their
wings angrily and thus produce the portentous reverberations.
The waters are the home of Unktahe, a
mighty spirit who lurks in their depths. Indeed, to
the Dakotas, and not to them alone, but to man in
their stage of thought, “All nature is alive with
gods. Every mountain, every tree is worshipped,
and the commonest animals are the objects of adoration.”<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<h4>10. THE KIOWAYS.</h4>

<p>The upper basin of the Canadian branch of the
Arkansas River was the home of the <i>Kioways</i>. At
the middle of this century they were estimated to be
over three thousand, all given to a wild hunting life
over the great plains on which they lived. In close
proximity to the Comanches and other tribes of
Shoshonian lineage, their language presents many
affinities to the Shoshonian stock, but not sufficient
in the opinion of those who have examined both to
justify classing them together as from a common
source.</p>

<p>The Kioways are light in color, broad shouldered
and strong armed, and for generations were the
Arabs of the Great American Desert, depending on
hunting and robbery for a subsistence. Their homes
were light skin lodges, which they spread on poles
about twelve feet long. With plenty of ponies and
without fixed habitations, it was easy for them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
move rapidly over the Plains. According to their
traditions they came originally from the North, from
some cold country, where they had to walk on snow
shoes, definitely located near the Black Hills, Dakota,
where they were associated with the Apaches. They
were idol worshippers, their priesthood consisting of
ten medicine-men. The dead were buried in deep
graves. At present they have been reduced to about
one thousand souls.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<h3 id="II_THE_NORTH_PACIFIC_GROUP">II. THE NORTH PACIFIC GROUP.</h3>

<h4>1. THE NORTHWEST COAST AND CALIFORNIAN TRIBES.</h4>

<p>The lofty chains of the Rocky Mountains extend
from north to south, leaving a narrow coast line
seamed with deep and fertile valleys along the Pacific
from Mt. St. Elias to the Gulf of California. In
spite of its great extent in latitude&mdash;from the 30th to
the 60th degree&mdash;there is less difference in climate
than one would suppose from analogy in any other
part of the world. The warm ocean current which
bathes the northern coast mitigates the cold of the
winter to such an extent that the isothermal lines on
the Pacific are fifteen degrees of latitude more northerly
than on the Atlantic border of the continent.</p>

<p>A few of the eastern stocks, the Athabascan and
the Shoshonian, have sent out colonies who have
settled on the banks of the Pacific; but as a rule the
tribes of the western coast are not connected with any
east of the mountains. What is more singular, although
they differ surprisingly among themselves in
language, they have marked anthropologic similarities,
physical and psychical. Virchow<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> has emphasized
the fact that the skulls from the northern point
of Vancouver’s Island reveal an unmistakable analogy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to those from the southern coast of California;
and this is to a degree true of many intermediate
points. Not that the crania have the same indices.
On the contrary, they present great and constant differences
within the same tribe;<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> but these differences
are analogous one to the other, and on fixed lines.</p>

<p>There are many other physical similarities which
mark the Pacific Indians and contrast them with
those east of the mountains. The eyes are less oblique,
the nose flatter, the lips fuller, the chin more
pointed, the face wider. There is more hair on the
face and in the axilla, and the difference between the
sexes is much more obvious.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The mental character is also in contrast. The
Pacific tribes are more quiet, submissive and docile;
they have less courage, and less of that untamable
independence which is so constant a feature in the
history of the Algonkins and Iroquois.</p>

<p>Beginning at the sixtieth degree of north latitude
and extending to the fifty-fifth, are the <i>Tlinkit</i> or
<i>Kolosch</i>. They dwell on the coast of Alaska and the
adjacent islands. Physically they are a strong and
often tall people, light in color, with black or slightly
reddish hair, eyes horizontal, nose aquiline. The
Russians spoke of them as the most intelligent tribe
they encountered on the coast. They certainly seem
to have developed an uncommon appreciation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
property, which is supposed to be a sign of a high
order of intellect. Thus they have a gentile system
with descent in the female line, but their aristocracy
and the selection of their chiefs are entirely on a
property basis. The richest obtain the highest
places.</p>

<p>The Tlinkit villages are permanent, the houses
solidly constructed of wood, sometimes with the additional
protection of a palisade. The carving and
painting upon them are elaborate, the subjects being
caricatures of faces, men, and animal forms. The
chiefs erect at one side of their doors carved and
painted “totem posts,” some of which are nearly
fifty feet high. These are also found among the
Haidahs and Tshimshians to the south. The arts
are correspondingly developed. Seaworthy canoes
are hewn from the trunks of the red cedar, hides are
dressed and the leather worked into a variety of
articles; lamps, mortars and utensils were chipped
or ground out of stone, and they are handy in beating
out ornaments of silver and copper. The
Tlinkits have always been active merchants, and
when the first navigators visited their villages in
1741, they were surprised to find them in possession
of iron knives and other articles obtained by trade
over East Cape or from the south. The usual currency
were the dentalium shells found along the
coast. One of the staple articles of trade were slaves,
a custom not in existence on the Atlantic. They
were bought from the neighboring tribes, and treated
with great cruelty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Tlinkit mythology is rich, having a coherent creation
and deluge myth, the principal figure in which
is <i>Jelchs</i>, the raven. He is the Promethean fire-bringer,
and sets free the sun, moon and stars from
their prisons. The religious rites are in the hands of
priests (shamans), who as usual exert a great and injurious
influence.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Haidahs</i>, who dwell on Queen Charlotte Islands
and Prince of Wales Archipelago, are probably a distant
branch of the Tlinkit, though the affinity has
not been clearly established, so they are officially
classed as the <i>Skittagetan</i> stock, from the Skidegate
dialect of the coast. In culture and appearance they
resemble the Tlinkits, having similar mechanical
skill. Their canoes and their intricate carvings,
especially totem-posts and pipes of black slate, are
celebrated products of the northwest coast.</p>

<p>The above and other tribes of British Columbia
and Washington, the Tshimshian, the Kwakiutl,
the Nootka, Salish, Chinook, etc., are so much alike
physically that Dr. Boas, who has carried out the
most recent and thorough examination of them, observes
that no physical distinctions can be drawn
between them.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> In some the hair is slightly wavy;
in others the nose is aquiline or flatter; the heads
of several are artificially deformed, etc.; but these
differences do not characterize whole stocks. All
have a great respect for wealth, and consider its accumulation
the chief object of life. Among them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
all, women are honored for their chastity and industry,
men for their skill in hunting and fishing,
and for their bravery in war. Their character is
generally sombre, and vanity and servility are
prominent faults. The animal totemic system generally
prevails, the child among the Salish and
Kwakiutl following the father’s gens. The communities
are divided into social strata, as common
people, middle class and chiefs. A favorite method
to obtain popularity is to give a <i>potlatch</i>&mdash;a great
feast, at which the host makes expensive presents to
the guests, and thus becomes as it were their creditor
to the amount of his disbursement.</p>

<p>The <i>Salish</i>, who are distinctively known as Flatheads,
though the custom of deforming the cranium
is not confined to them, occupied a large tract in
northern Washington and British Columbia.</p>

<p>The principal contribution of the Chinooks to
modern life has been the “Chinook jargon” which
has become the trade language of the coast. It is a
curious medley of words, and has been recently made
the subject of an interesting study by Mr. Horatio
Hale.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Sahaptins</i> or <i>Nez Percés</i>, with their affiliated
tribes, occupied the middle and upper valley of the
Columbia and its affluents, and also the passes of the
mountains. They were in contiguity with the
Shoshonees and the Algonkin Blackfeet, thus holding
an important position, intermediate between the
eastern and the Pacific tribes. Having the commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
instinct of the latter, they made good use of
it, and every summer carried the various products of
the coast, as shells, carved pipes, hammered copper,
etc., far down the Missouri, where they exchanged
them for the wares of the tribes there situate.</p>

<p>Of the numerous other linguistic stocks on the
coast it will be sufficient for me to append the classification
adopted by the Bureau of Ethnology at Washington.</p>

<h4>2. THE YUMAS.</h4>

<p>The valley of the Colorado River in Arizona, the
peninsula of California and portions of the eastern
shore of the Gulf of California, formed the home of
the Yuma stock. They were found in these regions
by Coronado as early as 1540, and own no traditions
of having lived anywhere else. The considerable
differences in their dialects within this comparatively
small area indicates that a long period has elapsed
since the stock settled in this locality and split up
into hostile fractions.</p>

<p>It has also been called the Katchan or Cuchan
stock, and the Apache, that being the Yuma word
for “fighting men”; but we should confine the
term Apaches to the Tinneh (Athapascan) tribe so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
called, and to avoid confusion I shall dismiss the
terms Apache-Yumas, Apache-Tontos and Apache-Mohaves,
employed by some writers. The Yumas,
from whom the stock derives its name, lived near the
mouth of the Colorado River. Above them, on both
banks of the river, were the Mohaves, and further up,
principally on Virgin River, were the Yavapai.</p>

<p>Most of the Yumas are of good stature, the adult
males averaging five feet nine inches high, well
built and vigorous. The color varies from a dark to
a light mahogany; the hair is straight and coarse,
the eyes horizontal, the mouth large, and the lips
heavy. The skull is generally brachycephalic, but
there are a number of cases of extreme dolichocephaly
(68).<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Animal totems with descent in the male line prevailed
among the Yumas, though they seem for a
long time not to have regarded these matters closely.
In culture they vary considerably. The Seris or
Ceris, who formerly lived in the hills near Horcasitas,
but in 1779 were removed to the island of Tiburon,
are described as thieves and vagrants, lazy and
wretched. They were exceedingly troublesome to
the Mexican government, having revolted over forty
times. The boats they use are of a peculiar construction,
consisting of rushes tied together. As
weapons up to recent years they preferred the bow
and arrow, and upon the arrow laid some kind of
poison which prevented the wounds from healing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Their dialect, which is harsh, is related especially to
the western branch of the Yuma stem. They are
described as light in color and some of them good-looking,
but filthy in habits.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The Yumas and Maricopas were agricultural, cultivating
large fields of corn and beans, and irrigating
their plantations by trenches. It is highly probable
that formerly some of them dwelt in adobe houses of
the pueblo character, and were the authors of some
of the numerous ruined structures seen in southern
Arizona. The pottery and basket work turned out
by their women are superior in style and finish. A
few years ago the Mohaves of the west bank lived in
holes in the earth covered with brush, or in small
wattled conical huts. For clothing they wore strips
of cottonwood bark, or knotted grass. Tattooing
and painting the person in divers colors were common.
The favorite ornament was shells, arranged
on strings, or engraved and suspended to the neck.
The chiefs wore elaborate feather head-dresses.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>The Tontos, so-called from their reputation for
stupidity, are largely mixed with Tinné blood, their
women having been captured from the Apaches.
Though savage, they are by no means dull, and are
considered uncommonly adept thieves.</p>

<p>Quite to the south, in the mountains of Oaxaca and
Guerrero, the Tequistlatecas, usually known by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
meaningless term Chontales, belong to this stem,
judging from the imperfect vocabularies which have
been published.</p>

<p>The peninsula of California was inhabited by several
Yuma tribes differing in dialect but much alike
in culture, all being on its lowest stage. Wholly unacquainted
with metals, without agriculture of any
kind, naked, and constructing no sort of permanent
shelters, they depended on fishing, hunting and natural
products for subsistence. Their weapons were
the bow and the lance, which they pointed with
sharpened stones. Canoes were unknown, and what
little they did in navigation was upon rafts of reeds
and brush.</p>

<p>Marriages among them were by individual preference,
and are said not to have respected the limits of
consanguinity; but this is doubtful, as we are also
told that the mother-in-law was treated with peculiar
ceremony. Their rites for the dead indicate a belief
in the survival of the individual. The body was
buried and after a certain time the bones were cleaned,
painted red, and preserved in ossuaries.</p>

<p>The population was sparse, probably not more
than ten thousand on the whole peninsula. At the

state that in appearance these bands did not differ
from the Mexicans on the other side of the Gulf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Their skulls, however, which have been collected
principally from the district of the Pericus, present a
peculiar degree of elongation and height (dolichocephalic
and hypsistenocephalic).</p>

<h4>3. THE PUEBLO TRIBES.</h4>

<p>The word <i>pueblo</i> in Spanish means simply “town;”
but in American ethnography it has obtained a
special signification from the aboriginal structures
so-called, whose remains are found in profusion in
Arizona and the neighboring localities over an area
about 350 miles from east to west and 300 miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
north to south.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> These are buildings several stories
in height, either of stone or of adobes, communal in
character, that is, intended to accommodate a whole
gens or clan, and usually with certain peculiarities of
finish and plan. The adobes are generally large,
some four feet long by two feet wide, and were often
made upon the wall itself, the clay or gravel being
carried in a moist state in baskets of this size and
deposited upon the wall till the mass dried. When
stones are employed, they are held together by a
mud mortar. The most celebrated of these adobe
edifices are perhaps the Casas Grandes in the valley
of the San Miguel river, in northern Chihuahua.
They have frequently been described and do not
differ except in size from hundreds of other ruins in
the Gila basin.</p>

<p>In connection with the pueblos stand the “cliff-houses,”
structures of stones usually carefully squared
and laid in mortar, found in great numbers and over
an area of wide extent in the deep gorges or cañons
of the Colorado, the Gila and the upper Rio Grande,
and their numberless affluents. They are perched
upon the ledges of the precipices, which often descend
almost perpendicularly for thousands of feet, and
access to many of them could have been only by
ladders or ropes. Prominent points are frequently
surmounted by round or square stone towers, evidently
for purposes of observation. The disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the cliff houses renders it certain that their plans
and positions were selected with a view to make them
safe retreats from marauding enemies.</p>

<p>As descriptions of these interesting ruins have often
been introduced to support vague and extraordinary
theories concerning ancient America, I would emphatically
say there is nothing in any of the remains
of the pueblos, or the cliff houses, or any other antiquities
in that portion of our continent, which compels
us to seek other constructors for them than the
ancestors of the various tribes which were found on
the spot by the Spaniards in the sixteenth century,
and by the armies of the United States in the middle
of the nineteenth. This opinion is in accordance
with history, with the traditions of the tribes themselves,
and with the condition of culture in which
they were found. When, in 1735, Pedro de Ainza
made an expedition from Santa Fé against the Navajos,
he discovered tribes dwelling in stone houses
“built within the rocks,” and guarded by watchtowers
of stone.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The Apaches still remember driving
these cliff-dwellers from their homes, and one of
the Apache gentes is yet named from them “stone-house
people.”<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> As for the pueblos, seven or eight
of them are occupied to-day by the same people who
built them, and whose homes they have been for
many centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a significant fact that these people do not all
belong to the same stock. On the contrary, the
“Pueblo Indians” are members of a number of wholly
disconnected stems. This proves that the Pueblo
civilization is not due to any one unusually gifted
lineage, but was a local product, developed in independent
tribes by the natural facilities offered by the
locality. It is a spontaneous production of the soil,
climate, and conditions, which were unusually favorable
to agricultural and sedentary occupations, and
prompted various tribes to adopt them.</p>

<p>Of these different peoples, those of the Moqui
Pueblo belonged to the Shoshonee branch of the Uto-Aztecan
stock, and is the only existing Pueblo which
is peopled by that widespread stem.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> We have good
reason to believe, however, that the Pimas of the
Sonoran Group of the same stock once occupied a
number of adobe Pueblos, and quite likely were the
constructors of the Casas Grandes.</p>

<p>The natives of the remaining Pueblos belong to
three independent stocks, known as the Kera, the
Tehua, and the Zuñi families. No relationship has
been discovered between either of these and any tribe
outside the territory I have referred to.</p>

<p>The culture of the Pueblos, both ancient and
modern, bears every mark of local and independent
growth. A knowledge of metals, other than to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
limited extent for ornament, is nowhere evident.
Tillage of the fields in a rude manner was the main
source of the food supply. Pottery of fine temper
and in symmetrical forms was manufactured by the
women. That they had any other domestic animal
than a fowl, and sometimes a dog, has not been
shown. Mats and clothing were woven of the fibres
of bark and grass, and the culture of cotton was at
one time common, especially among the Moquis and
Pimas. The arts of weaving feathers and working
shells into decorative objects are not yet lost. Apart
from the development of the art of architecture, there
was little in the culture of the Pueblo tribes to lift
them above the level of the Algonkins. The
acequias, or irrigation trenches, about which much
has been written, were a necessity of their climate,
and were in use among their southern neighbors in
Sonora, and the Navajos.</p>

<h3 id="III_THE_CENTRAL_GROUP">III. THE CENTRAL GROUP.</h3>

<h4>1. THE UTO-AZTECAN TRIBES.</h4>

<p>Of all the stocks on the North American Continent,
that which I call the <i>Uto-Aztecan</i> merits the
closest study, on account of its wide extension and
the high development of some of its members.
Tribes speaking its dialects were found from the
Isthmus of Panama to the banks of the Columbia
River, and from the coast of the Pacific to the Gulf of
Mexico. The relationship of these numerous bands
is unquestionable, although many of them have
freely adopted words from other stocks. This, however,
will not surprise us if we recall that most of
the Aryac languages of the old world owe about one
third of their radicals to non-Aryac sources.</p>

<p>The principal members of this stock are the Utes,
Shoshonees and Comanches in the north, various
tribes in Sonora, Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Durango
in the center, and the Nahuas or Aztecs in the south.
It is not to be understood that the one of these
derived its idioms from the other, but rather that at
some remote epoch all three were offshoots from
some one ancestral stem. This was at a period before
the grammatical forms of the tongue had reached
full development, and probably when it was in a
stage of isolation, with tendencies to suffix agglutination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and incorporation. Since then the stages of
growth which the several dialects have reached have
been various. The one which far outstripped all
others was the Nahuatl, which arrived at clear and
harmonious sounds, fixed forms, and even some recognizable
traces of inflection, though always retaining
its incorporative character.</p>

<p>The establishment of the unity of this linguistic
family we owe to the admirable labors of Joh. Carl
Ed. Buschmann, who devoted years of patient investigation
to examining the traces of the Nahuatl, or as
he preferred to call it, the Aztec language, in Mexico
and throughout the continent to the north. In spite
of deficient materials, his sharp-sighted acumen discovered
the relationship of the chief tongues of the
group, and later investigations have amply confirmed
his conclusions.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Long before his day, however, the Spanish missionaries
to the tribes of Sonora and Sinaloa had
recognized their kinship to the Aztecs, and Father
Ribas, in his history of the missions established by
the Jesuits in Mexico, published in 1645, stated that
the root-words and much of the grammar of all these
dialects was substantially the same as those of the
Nahuatl.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>It is without doubt the most numerous stock now
surviving. According to the census figures of the
governments of the United States and Mexico for
1880, the numbers were as follows:<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<h5><i>a. The Ute or Shoshonian Branch.</i></h5>

<p>The northern, or Ute branch, which I so call from
its most prominent member, includes the Shoshonees,
Utes and Comanches, with their numerous sub-tribes
and affiliated bands. They occupied at the beginning
of this century an immense area, now included
in south-eastern Oregon, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho,
Nevada, parts of California, New Mexico and Arizona,
northern and western Texas, and the states of
Durango and Chihuahua in Mexico. Other names
by which they are known in this area are Snakes,
Bannocks, Moquis, etc. Everywhere their tongue is
unmistakably the same. “Any one speaking the
Shoshonee language may travel without difficulty
among the wild tribes from Durango, in Mexico, to
the banks of the Columbia River.”<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Their war
parties scoured the country from the Black Hills of
Dakota far into the interior of Mexico.</p>

<p>So far as can be ascertained, the course of migration
of this group, like that of the whole stock, has
been in a general southerly direction. The Comanche
traditions state that about two hundred winters
ago they lived as one people with the Shoshonees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
somewhere to the north of the head-waters of the
Arkansas River.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> This is borne out by similar traditions
among the northern Shoshonees.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> That very
careful student, Mr. George Gibbs, from a review of
all the indications, reached the conclusion that the
whole group came originally from the east of the
Rocky Mountain chain, and that the home of its
ancestral horde was somewhere between these mountains
and the Great Lakes.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> This is the opinion I
have also reached from an independent study of the
subject, and I believe it is as near as we can get to
the birth-place of this important stock.</p>

<p>This stock presents the extreme of both linguistic
and physical development. No tongue on the
continent was more cultured than the Nahuatl, and
so were those who spoke it. The wretched root-digging
Utes, on the other hand, present the lowest
type of skulls anywhere found in America.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The
explanation is easy. It was owing to their lack of
nutrition. Living on the arid plains of the interior,
little better than deserts, they had for generations
been half starved. They were not agricultural, but
lived along the streams, catching fish, and making a
poor bread from the seeds of the wild sun-flower and
the chenopodium. Their houses were brush huts, or
lodges of dressed buffalo skins; and where the winters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
were cold, they dug holes in the ground in which
they huddled in indescribable filth.</p>

<p>Very much superior to these are the Comanches.
A generation or two ago they numbered about fifteen
thousand, and were one of the most formidable nations
of the west. Now they have diminished to
that many hundreds, and live peaceably on reservations.
They are tall (1.70) and well formed, the
skull mesocephalic, the eyes horizontal, the nose
thin, the color light. Agriculture is not a favorite
occupation, but they are more reasonable and willing
to accept a civilized life than their neighbors, the
Apaches or the Kioways. They had little government,
and though polygamists, the women among
them exercised considerable influence. Like the
Utes, they are sun-worshippers, applying to that orb
the term “father sun,” <i>taab-apa</i>, and performing
various dances and other rites in his honor. The serpent
would seem also to come in for a share of their
reverence, their tribal sign in the gesture speech of
the plain being that for a snake,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and indeed they
are often called Snake Indians. Not less interesting
is it to find throughout all these tribes, Ute and Comanche,
the deification of the coyote, which occupies
so prominent a niche in the pantheon of the Aztecan
tribes and those who have borrowed from them. According
to the Ute myths, the wolf and the coyote
were the first two brothers from whom the race had
its origin, and to the latter were attributed all the
good things in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>As we approach the southern border of the group,
the stage of culture becomes higher. The natives of
the Pueblo of Moqui, whose curious serpent-worship
has been so well described by Captain Bourke,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> are
of this stock, and illustrate its capacity for developing
a respectable civilization. The Kizh and Netela,
who were attached to the mission of San Capistrano,
were also Shoshonees.</p>

<h5><i>b. The Sonoran Branch.</i></h5>

<p>In the valley of the Gila river the Shoshonian and
Sonoran branches of the Uto-Aztecan stock were in
contact from time immemorial. The Sonoran
branch begins on the north with the Pimas, who occupied
the middle valley of the Gila, and the land
south of it quite to the Rio Yaqui. I continue for it
the name of <i>Sonoran</i> given by Buschmann, although
it extended far beyond the bounds of that province.</p>

<p>The Pima tribe merits our special attention, because
of the remarkable ruins and relics of a dense
former population, sedentary and agricultural, in the
region inhabited by it when the river basin was first
explored. These are the large structures known as
the Great Houses or Casas Grandes, and the remains
of the numerous towns, extensive irrigating trenches,
and ruined enclosures, brought to light by the Hemenway
exploring expedition in the Salt river valley.
Their walls were built of adobes or sun-dried bricks
of large size, the clay probably placed in baskets
upon the wall and allowed to dry there. The extent
of these remains is surprising, and in the Salt river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
valley alone, in an area of half a million acres, it is
estimated that two hundred thousand people may
have found support. Making every allowance, there
is no doubt that at some remote epoch the arable land
in the valleys of the Gila and its affluents was under
close cultivation.</p>

<p>Who these busy planters were has supplied material
for much speculation. As usual, the simplest explanation
has been the last to be welcomed. In fact,
there is no occasion for us to look elsewhere than to
the ancestors of these Pimas, who lived in the valley
when the whites first traveled it. There is nothing
in the ruins and relics which demands a higher culture
than the Pimas possessed. There is no sign of a
knowledge of metals beyond hammered copper; the
structures are such as the Pueblo Indians of the same
stock live in now; and the Pimas have a historic
tradition which claims these ruins and these old
fields as the work of their ancestors, from which they
were driven by the repeated attacks of the Apaches
and other savage tribes of the north.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Some of them,
a sub-tribe called the Sobaypuris (Sabaguis), and
doubtless many others, took refuge in the deep cañons
and constructed along their precipitous sides those
“cliff houses,” which have been often described.
About a hundred years ago the Apaches drove them
out of these last resorts and forced them to flee to the
main body of the Pimas in the south.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> In conclusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
we may safely attribute most of the ruins in the
Gila Basin, as well as most of the cliff houses in the
various cañons, to these tribes of the Uto-Aztecan
stock. When the early missionaries reached the
Pimas they found them in precisely the condition of
culture of which we see the remains in the Salt
River valley. Their houses were built of large
adobes, sometimes roofed with tiles; they were agricultural
and industrious; their fields were irrigated
by like extensive canals or trenches, and their
weapons, utensils and clothing were just such as the
Hemenway expedition showed were those of the early
accolents of the Gila and the Salado.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Most of the other tribes of this group were, from
the first knowledge we have of them, inclined to sedentary
and agricultural lives. The Opatas, on the
head-waters of the Rio Yaqui, and the Tarahumaras,
in the valleys of the Sierra Madre, are quiet, laborious
peoples, who accepted without difficulty the teachings
of the early missionaries. They cultivate the ground
and build houses of adobes or of wood plastered.</p>

<p>The Tehuecos, Zuaques, Mayos and Yaquis are sub-tribes
of the Cahitas, and speak a dialect the most
akin of any to the Nahuatl. They are tall, vigorous
men, active and laborious, trading in salt and
woolen stuffs, cheerful, and much given to music.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
South of the Tarahumaras and immediately adjoining
them, in the State of Chihuahua, are the Tepehuanas
on the eastern slope of the Sierra Madre,
from 25° to 27° latitude north. They are a people
of unusual intelligence, of excellent memory, and
when first met were living in solid houses of logs or
of stone and clay, or as genuine troglodytes in artificial
caves, and cultivating abundant crops of maize
and cotton, which latter they wove and dyed with
much skill.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The chroniclers speak of them as the
most valiant of all the tribes of New Spain, but
laborious and devoted to their fields.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The tribe of the Sonoran group which reached the
point furthest to the south was the Coras, who dwelt
in the Sierra of Nayarit, in the State of Jalisco. From
their location they are sometimes called Nayerits.
They were a warlike but agricultural people, about
the same level as the Tepehuanas.</p>

<p>The Tubares were a peaceable nation living in the
Sierra of Sinaloa. They received the missionaries
willingly and seem to have been an industrious tribe,
their principal object of commerce being articles of
clothing. It is said that they spoke two entirely distinct
languages, one a dialect of Nahuatl, the other of unknown
affinities.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The Guazapares and the Varogios<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
are described as living near the Tubares, on the head-waters
of the Rio del Fuerte, and speaking the same
or a similar dialect.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>In the defiles of the lofty range, which is sometimes
called the Sierra de Topia, resided the Acaxees,
Xiximes and other wild tribes, speaking related
tongues. By some authorities they are alleged to belong
to the Sonoran group, but as the material is
lacking for comparison, their ethnographic position
must be left undetermined.</p>

<p>The Guaymas, on the coast of the Gulf of California,
south of the Ceris (a Yuma folk), have been ascertained
by Mr. Pinart to speak a dialect allied to that
of the southern Pimas, and are therefore to be added
to this group. Another Pima dialect was the Bacorehui,
spoken by the Batucaris and Comoparis on the
lower Rio del Fuerte; as it was also that of the
Ahomes, a distinctly Pima people.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The uniform tradition of all the tribes of this stock
in Sonora and Sinaloa, so far as they were obtained
by the early missionaries, was to the effect that their
ancestors had migrated from localities further to the
north.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<h5><i>c. The Nahuatl Branch.</i></h5>

<p>Under the term <i>Nahuas</i>, which has the excellent
authority of Sahagun in its favor, I shall include all
the tribes of the Uto-Aztecan stock who spoke the
Nahuatl language, that called by Buschmann the
Aztec, and often referred to as the Mexican. These
tribes occupied the slope of the Pacific coast from
about the Rio del Fuerte in Sinaloa, N. lat. 26°, to
the frontiers of Guatemala, except a portion at the
isthmus of Tehuantepec. Beyond this line, they had
colonies under the name of Pipiles on the coast of
Guatemala, and in the interior the Alaguilacs. The
Cuitlatecos, or Tecos, “dung-hill people,” was a
term of depreciation applied to those in Michoacan
and Guerrero. On the borders of the lakes in the
valley of Mexico were the three important states
Tezcuco, Tlacopan and Tenochtitlan, who at the
time of the conquest were formed into a confederacy
of wide sway.</p>

<p>The last mentioned, Tenochtitlan, had its chief
town where the city of Mexico now stands, and its
inhabitants were the Azteca. East of the valley were
the Tlascaltecs, an independent tribe; south of and
along the shore of the gulf from Vera Cruz almost to
the mouth of the Rio de Grijalva, were Nahuatl tribes
under the dominion of the confederacy. An isolated,
but distinctly affiliated band, had wandered down to
Nicaragua, where under the name Nicaraos they
were found on the narrow strip of land between Lake
Nicaragua and the Pacific, which they had conquered
from tribes of Chapanec lineage. The most distant
of all were the Seguas, who at the time of the conquest
resided in the Valle Coaza, on the Rio Telorio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and later moved to Chiriqui Lagoon. After the
conquest they were scattered still further by the
transportation of colonies of Tlascalans to Saltillo
in the north, and to Isalco in San Salvador in the
south.</p>

<p>I omit entirely from this group the Toltecs and the
Chichimecs. These were never tribal designations,
and it is impossible to identify them with any known
communities. The Toltecs may have been one of
the early and unimportant gentes of the Azteca, but
even this is doubtful. The term was properly applied
to the inhabitants of the small town of Tula,
north of the valley of Mexico. In later story they
were referred to as a mythical people of singular gifts
and wide domain. Modern and uncritical writers
have been misled by these tales, and have represented
the Toltecs as a potent nation and ancestors
of the Aztecs. There is no foundation for such
statements, and they have no historic position.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The term Chichimeca was applied to many barbarous
hordes as a term of contempt, “dogs,” “dog
people.”<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> It has no ethnic signification, and never
had, but was used in much the same way as <i>Cuitlateca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></i>,
above referred to.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The government of these states did not differ in
principle from that of the northern tribes, though its
development had reached a later stage. Descent was
generally reckoned in the male line, and the male
children of the deceased were regarded as the natural
heirs both to his property and his dignities. Where
the latter, however, belonged rather to the gens
than the individual, a form of election was held, the
children of the deceased being given the preference.
In this sense, which was the usual limitation in
America, many positions were hereditary, including
that of the chieftaincy of the tribe or confederation.
The Montezuma who was the ruler who received
Cortez, was the grandson of Axayacatl, who in turn
was the son of the first Montezuma, each of whom
exercised the chief power.</p>

<p>The land was held by the gens and allotted to its
members for cultivation. Marriage was also an affair
regulated by the gentile laws of consanguinity, but
the position of woman was not specially inferior, and
in the instance of the daughter of the first Montezuma,
one seems to have occupied the position of
head chief for a time.</p>

<p>The general condition of the arts in ancient Mexico
is familiar to all who have turned their attention to
American history. It has indeed received more than
its due share of attention from the number and prominence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of the Nahuas at the conquest. They were
little if at all superior to many of their neighbors in
cultural progress. Even in architecture, where they
excelled, the Zapotecs, Totonacos and Tarascos were
but little behind them. Numerous artificial pyramids
and structures of hewn stone remain in the territories
of all these to prove their skill as builders.
The Mexicans may be said to have reached the age
of bronze. Many weapons, utensils and implements,
were manufactured of this alloy of copper and tin.
Gold, silver, lead and copper, were likewise deftly
worked by founding and smelting into objects of
ornament or use. Lead was also known, but not
utilized. The majority of implements continued to
be of stone. They were fortunate in having for this
purpose a most excellent material, obsidian, which
volcanic product is abundant in Mexico. From it
they flaked off arrow points, knives and scrapers, and
by polishing worked it into labrets and mirrors. A
variety of nephrite or jade was highly esteemed, and
some of the most elaborate specimens of Mexican art
in stone are in this hard, greenish material. Fragments
of colored stones were set in mosaic, either as
masks, knife handles or the like, with excellent effect.</p>

<p>With the undoubtedly dense population of many
districts, the tillage of the ground was a necessary
source of the food supply. The principal crop was as
usual maize, but beans, peppers, gourds and fruit
were also cultivated. Cotton was largely employed
for clothing, being neatly woven and dyed in brilliant
colors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The religious rites were elaborate and prescribed
with minuteness. Priests and priestesses were vowed
to the cult of certain deities. Their duties consisted
in sweeping and decorating the temples, in preparing
the sacrifices, and in chanting at certain periods of
the day and night. The offerings were usually of
quails, rabbits or flowers, but, especially in Tenochtitlan,
human sacrifices were not infrequent. The
victims were slaves or captives taken in war. At
times their flesh was distributed to the votaries, and
was consumed as part of the ceremony; but as this
was a rite, the Aztecs cannot be said to have been
anthropophagous.</p>

<p>The priestly class had charge of the education of
the youth of the better class. This was conducted
with care and severity. Large buildings were set
apart for the purpose, some for boys, others for girls.
The boys were taught martial exercises, the history
of the nation, the chants and dances of the religious
worship, forms of salutation, the art of writing, etc.
The girls were instructed in household duties, the
preparation of food, the manufacture of garments,
and the morals of domestic life.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>The literature which represented this education
was large. It was preserved in books written upon
parchment, or upon paper manufactured from the
fibrous leaves of the maguey. This was furnished in
great quantities from different parts of the realm, as
much as 24,000 bundles being required by the government
annually as tribute. A book consisted of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
strip of paper perhaps twenty feet long, folded like a
screen into pages about six inches wide, on both sides
of which were painted the hieroglyphic characters.
These were partly ideographic, partly phonetic; the
latter were upon the principle of the rebus, conveying
the name or word by the representation of some
object, the word for which had a similar sound. I
have called this the <i>ikonomatic</i> method of writing,
and have explained it in detail in several essays on
the subject.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Their calendar recognized the length of the year
as 365 days. The mathematical difficulties in the
way of a complete understanding of it have not yet
been worked out, and it may have differed in the
various tribes. Its elements were a common property
of all the Nahua peoples, as well as many of their
neighbors; which of them first devised it has not been
ascertained.</p>

<h4>2. THE OTOMIS.</h4>

<p>According to Aztec tradition, the Otomis were the
earliest owners of the soil of Central Mexico. Their
language was at the conquest one of the most widely
distributed of any in this portion of the continent.
Its central regions were the states of Queretaro and
Guanajuato; from the upper portion of the valley of
Mexico it extended north to the Rio Verde, on the
west it adjoined the Tarascans of Michoacan, and on the
east the Huastecs of Panuco.</p>

<p>The Otomis are below the average stature, of dark
color, the skull markedly dolichocephalic,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> the nose
short and flattened, the eyes slightly oblique. Following
the lead of some of the old writers, modern
authors have usually represented the Otomis as rude
savages, far inferior to the Nahuas. Doubtless the
latter often so represented them, but this does not
correspond with what we learn of them from other
sources. Although subjected by the Nahuas, they do
not seem to have been excessively ignorant. Agriculture
was not neglected, and from their cotton the
women wove clothing for both sexes. Ornaments of
gold, copper and hard stones were in use; their religion
was conducted with ceremony;<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and they were
famous for their songs and musical ability.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The
members of the nation to-day are laborious, good
tempered, and endowed with a remarkable aptitude
for imitation, especially in sculpture. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
women are quite handsome.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Their language has attracted a certain amount of
attention, partly from its supposed similarity to the
Chinese, partly because it is alleged to differ from
most American tongues in showing no incorporation.
Both of these statements have been proved erroneous.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
It is a tongue largely monosyllabic, of extremely
difficult enunciation, worn down by attrition
almost to an isolating form, but not devoid of the
usual traits of the languages of the continent. There
are several dialects, the relations of which have been
the subject of fruitful investigations.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<h4>3. THE TARASCOS.</h4>

<p>The Tarascans, so called from <i>Taras</i>, the name of a
tribal god,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> had the reputation of being the tallest
and handsomest people of Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>They were the inhabitants of the present State of
Michoacan, west of the valley of Mexico. According
to their oldest traditions, or perhaps those of their
neighbors, they had migrated from the north in company
with, or about the same time as the Aztecs.
For some three hundred years before the conquest
they had been a sedentary, semi-civilized people,
maintaining their independence, and progressing
steadily in culture.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> When first encountered by the
Spaniards they were quite equal and in some respects
ahead of the Nahuas. The principal buildings of
their cities, the chief of which was their capital
Tzintzuntan, were of cut stone well laid in mortar.
A number of remains of such have been reported by
various travelers, many of them being conical mounds
of dressed stones, locally called <i>yacates</i>, which probably
are sepulchral monuments.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>In their costume the Tarascos differed considerably
from their neighbors. The feather garments which
they manufactured surpassed all others in durability
and beauty. Cotton was, however, the usual material.
Gold and copper are found in the mountains
of the district, and both these metals were worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with skill. Nowhere else do we find such complete
defensive armor; it consisted of helmet, body pieces,
and greaves for the legs and arms, all of wood covered
neatly with copper or gold plates, so well done that
the pieces looked as if they were of solid metal.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>A form of picture-writing was in use in Michoacan,
but no specimen of it has been preserved. The calendar
was nearly the same as that in Mexico, and the
government apparently more absolute in form. Many
but confused details have been preserved about their
religion and rites. There was a mysterious supreme
divinity, Tucapacha, though Curicaneri, who is said to
have represented the sun, was the deity chiefly worshipped.
Large idols of stone and many of smaller
size of terra cotta may still be exhumed by the energetic
archæologist. Cremation was in vogue for the
disposition of the dead, and human sacrifices, both at
funerals and in the celebration of religious rites, were
usual.</p>

<p>The Tarascan language is harmonious and vocalic,
and its grammar is thoroughly American in character,
the verb being extraordinarily developed, the
substantive incorporated in the expression of action,
and the modifications of this conveyed by numerous
infixes and suffixes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<h4>4. THE TOTONACOS.</h4>

<p>The first natives whom Cortes met on landing in
Mexico were the <i>Totonacos</i>. They occupied the territory
of Totonicapan, now included in the state
of Vera Cruz. According to traditions of their own,
they had resided there eight hundred years, most of
which time they were independent, though a few
generations before the arrival of the Spaniards they
had been subjected by the arms of the Montezumas.
The course of their early migrations they stated had
been from the west and northwest, and they claimed
to have been the constructors of the remarkable
pyramids and temples of Teotihuacan, ten miles
northwest of the city of Mexico. This boast we may
be chary of believing, but they were unquestionably
a people of high culture. Sahagun describes them
as almost white in color, their heads artificially deformed,
but their features regular and handsome.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
Robes of cotton beautifully dyed served them for
garments, and their feet were covered with sandals.
The priests wore long black gowns with collars, so
that they looked like Dominican monks. The religion
which prevailed among them was a sun-worship
with elaborate rites, among which were the
circumcision of boys and a similar operation on girls.</p>

<p>These people were highly civilized. Cempoalla,
their capital city, was situate about five miles from
the sea, at the junction of two streams. Its houses
were of brick and mortar, and each was surrounded
by a small garden, at the foot of which a stream of
fresh water was conducted. Fruit trees and grain
fields filled the gardens and surrounded the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Altogether, says the chronicler, it was like a terrestrial
paradise.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> That this description is not overdrawn,
is proved by the remarkable ruins which
still exist in this province, and the abundant relics
of ancient art which have been collected there,
especially by the efforts of Mr. Hermann Strebel,
whose collections now form part of the Berlin Ethnographic
Museum.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>The affinities of the Totonacos are difficult to make
out. Sahagun says that they claimed kinship with
the Huastecs, their neighbors to the north, which
would bring them into the Maya stock. Their language
has, in fact, many words from Maya roots, but
it has also many more from the Nahuatl, and its
grammar is more in accord with the latter than with
the former.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Besides these, there is a residuum
which is different from both. For this reason I class
them as an independent stock, of undetermined connections.</p>

<h4>5. THE ZAPOTECS AND MIXTECS.</h4>

<p>The greater part of Oaxaca and the neighboring
regions are still occupied by the Zapotecs, who call
themselves <i>Didja-Za</i>.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> There are now about 265,000
of them, about fifty thousand of whom speak nothing
but their native tongue. In ancient times they constituted
a powerful independent state, the citizens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
which seem to have been quite as highly civilized as
any member of the Aztecan family. They were
agricultural and sedentary, living in villages and
constructing buildings of stone and mortar. The
most remarkable, but by no means the only specimens
of these still remaining are the ruins of Mitla,
called by the natives <i>Ryo Ba</i>, the “entrance to the
sepulchre,” the traditional belief being that these imposing
monuments are sepulchres of their ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
These ruins consist of thirty-nine houses, some of
adobe, but most of stone, and two artificial hills.
The stone houses have thick walls of rough stone
and mortar, faced with polished blocks arranged in a
variety of symmetrical patterns, such as are called
grecques. Sometimes these patterns are repeated on
the inner walls, but more frequently these were
plastered with a hard white coat and painted an
Indian red, with numerous figures. These delineations
are on a par with those from the valley of
Mexico and the ancient cities of Yucatan, and reveal
much the same technique. One of the rooms is
called the “hall of the columns,” from six round
monolithic columns nearly ten feet in height, which
were intended to support a roof of heavy stone slabs.</p>

<p>The Mixtecs adjoined the Zapotecs to the west,
extending along the coast of the Pacific to about the
present port of Acapulco. In culture they were
equal to the Zapotecs; having a preference for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
agricultural life, constructing residences of brick and
stone and acquainted with a form of picture or hieroglyphic
writing, in which they perpetuated the memory
of their elaborate mythology.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> They pretended
to have taken their name from Mixtecatl, one of the
seven heroes who set out from Chicomoztoc, “the
land of seven caves,” far in the north, and at other
times pretended descent from the fabulous Toltecs,
claims which Sahagun intimates were fictions of the
Nahuas living among them.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>The Zapotecs made use of a calendar, the outlines
of which have been preserved. It is evidently upon
the same astronomical theory as the Mexican, as was
their system of enumeration. Their language is not
inharmonious. It is called the <i>ticha za</i>, “language of
the noble people.”</p>

<h4>6. THE ZOQUES AND MIXES.</h4>

<p>The mountain regions of the isthmus of Tehuantepec
and adjacent portions of the states of Chiapas
and Oaxaca are the habitats of the Zoques, Mixes, and
allied tribes. The early historians draw a terrible
picture of their valor, savagery and cannibalism,
which reads more like tales to deter the Spaniards
from approaching their domains than truthful accounts.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
However this may be, they have been for
hundreds of years a peaceful, ignorant, timid part of
the population, homely, lazy and drunken, but not
violent or dangerous. The Mixes especially cultivate
abundance of maize and beans, and take an interest
in improving the roads leading to their towns.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The faint traditions of these peoples pointed to the
south for their origin. When they lived in Chiapas
they were conquered by the Chapanecs (Mangues),
and this induced many of them to seek independence
in the Sierra to the north and west. At present the
main village of the Mixes is San Juan Guichicovi,
while the Zoques are scattered between the Rio del
Corte and the Rio Chiapa. They are described as
agricultural and laborious, but also as stupid, inclined
to drunkenness, and very homely.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>A comparison of the two languages leaves no doubt
as to their derivation from a common stem.</p>

<h4>7. THE CHINANTECS.</h4>

<p>The Chinantecs inhabited Chinantla, which is a
part of the state of Oaxaca, situated in the Sierra
Madre, on the frontiers of the province of Vera Cruz.
Their neighbors on the south were the Zapotecs and
Mixes, and on the north and east the Nahuas. They
lived in secluded valleys and on rough mountain sides,
and their language was one of great difficulty to the
missionaries on account of its harsh phonetics.
Nevertheless, Father Barreda succeeded in writing a
<i>Doctrina</i> in it, published in 1730, the only work
which has ever appeared in the tongue. The late
Dr. Berendt devoted considerable study to it, and
expressed his conclusions in the following words:
“Spoken in the midst of a diversity of languages
connected more or less among themselves, it is itself
unconnected with them, and is rich in peculiar features
both as to its roots and its grammatical structure.
It is probable that we have in it one of the original
languages spoken before the advent of the Nahuas on
Mexican soil, perhaps the mythical Olmecan.”<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>The Chinantecs had been reduced by the Aztecs
and severely oppressed by them. Hence they welcomed
the Spaniards as deliverers. Their manners
were savage and their disposition warlike.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Other
names by which they are mentioned are <i>Tenez</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
<i>Teutecas</i>.</p>

<h4>8. THE CHAPANECS AND MANGUES.</h4>

<p>In speaking of the province of Chiapas the historian
Herrera informs us that it derived its name from the
pueblo so-called, “whose inhabitants were the most
remarkable in New Spain for their traits and inclinations.”<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
They had early acquired the art of
horsemanship, they were skillful in all kinds of
music, excellent painters, carried on a variety of arts,
and were withal very courteous to each other.</p>

<p>One tradition was that they had reached Chiapas
from Nicaragua, and had conquered the territory
they possessed from the Zoques, some of whom they
had rendered tributary, while others had retired
further into the Sierra. But the more authentic
legend of the Chapas or Chapanecs, as they were
properly called from their totemic bird the <i>Chapa</i>,
the red macaw, recited that their whole stock moved
down from a northern latitude, following the Pacific
coast until they came to Soconusco, where they
divided, one part entering the mountains of Chiapas,
the other proceeding on to Nicaragua, where we find
them under the name of Mangues, or Chorotegans,
along the shores of Lake Managua.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Here they occupied
a number of populous villages, estimated by
the historian Oviedo to contain about forty thousand
souls.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> They were agricultural and sedentary, and
moderately civilized, that is, they had hieroglyphic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
books, wove and spun cotton, were skilled in pottery
and had fixed government. They are described as
lighter in color than most Indians, and wearing long
hair carefully combed. A small band wandered still
further south, to the vicinity of Chiriqui Lagoon.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>The Chapanec language is one of marked individuality.
Its phonetics are harmonious, but with many
obscure and fluctuating sounds. In its grammatical
construction we find a singular absence of distinction
between subject and object. While the appreciation
of number in the form of nouns is almost absent,
their relations are expressed with excessive particularity,
so that a noun may have different forms, as it
is used in different relations.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> There is comparatively
slight development of the polysynthetic structure
which is generally seen in American languages.</p>

<h4>9. CHONTALS AND POPOLOCAS; TEQUISELATECAS
AND MATAGALPAS.</h4>

<p>According to the census of 1880 there were 31,000
Indians in Mexico belonging to the <i>Familia Chontal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
No such family exists. The word <i>chontalli</i> in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Nahuatl language means simply “stranger,” and
was applied by the Nahuas to any people other than
their own. According to the Mexican statistics, the
Chontals are found in the states of Mexico, Puebla,
Oaxaca, Guerrero, Tobasco, Guatemala and Nicaragua.
A similar term is <i>popoloca</i>, which in Nahuatl
means a coarse fellow, one speaking badly, that is,
broken Nahuatl. The popolocas have also been
erected into an ethnic entity by some ethnographers,
with as little justice as the Chontallis. They are
stated to have lived in the provinces of Puebla,
Oaxaca, Vera Cruz, Mechoacan, and Guatemala.
Sometimes the same tribe has been called both
Chontales and Popoloras, which would be quite correct
in the Nahuatl tongue, since in it these words
are common nouns and nearly synonymous in signification;
but employed in an ethnographic sense,
they have led to great confusion, and the blending
into one of distinct nationalities. I shall attempt to
unravel this snarl as far as the linguistic material at
my command permits.</p>

<p>The Chontales of Oaxaca lived on the Pacific coast
on the Cordillera in that State, in the Sierra Quiegolani.
They were brought under instruction in the
latter part of the sixteenth century by Father Diego
Carranza, who labored among them for twelve years
with gratifying success, and wrote a <i>Doctrina</i>, <i>Sermones</i>
and <i>Ejercicios Espirituales</i> in their language.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
Unfortunately these works are no longer to be found,
and the only specimen of their idiom which I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
obtained is a vocabulary of 23 words, collected by
John Porter Bliss in 1871. This is too limited to
admit of positive identification; but it certainly shows
several coincidences with the Yuma linguistic stock.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
Provisionally, however, I give it the name of <i>Tequistlatecan</i>,
from the principal village of the tribe,
where Father Carranza built his church. The Chontales
of Guerrero were immediately adjacent to those
of Oaxaca, in the same Sierra, and there is every
reason to believe that they belonged to the same
family; and from their location, history and associations,
I do not doubt that Orozco y Berra was right
in placing the Triquis in the same family.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>The Chontales of Tabasco occupied most of the
basin of the Rio Grijalva. Herrera states that their
language was that in general use in the province, being
richer in words than the Zoque, or the provincial
Mexican which has been introduced.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> This leads us
to believe that it was a Maya dialect, a supposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
confirmed by a MS. vocabulary obtained by the late
Dr. C. H. Berendt. By this it is seen that the Chontal
of Tabasco is a member of the numerous Maya
family, and practically identical with the Tzendal
dialect.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>In Nicaragua two entirely different peoples have
been called Chontales. The first of these is also
sometimes mentioned as Popolucas. Their tongue
is, or a generation ago was, current in and around
the city of Matagalpa and in various hamlets of the
departments of Matagalpa, Segovia and Chontales.
The only specimen I know of it is a vocabulary, obtained
in 1874 by the Rev. Victor Noguera, and supplied
by him to Dr. Berendt. It contains a small percentage
of words from the neighboring dialects, but
in the mass is wholly different, and I consider it an
independent stock, to which I give the name <i>Matagalpan</i>.</p>

<p>The second Chontales of Nicaragua are those mentioned
as Chontal-lencas by M. Désiré Pector, and
are none other than the Lencas described by Mr. E.
G. Squier.</p>

<p>The Chontal of Honduras is located geographically
in those regions where the Chorti dialect of the Maya
stock prevails, and there is no reasonable doubt but
that it is Chorti and nothing more.</p>

<p>The Chontales described by Mr. E. G. Squier as
living in the mountains north of Lake Nicaragua,
about the sources of the Blewfield river, and of whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
language he gives a short vocabulary,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> are proved by
this to be members of the extensive family of the
Ulvas.</p>

<p>Of the various tribes called Popolocas, that living
at the period of the conquest in and near Puebla was
the most important. Their chief city was Tecamachcalco,
and they occupied most of the old province of
Tepeaca. We can form some idea of their number
from the statement that in the year 1540 Father Francisco
de las Navas visited their country for missionary
purposes, and in less than two months converted (!)
and baptized 12,000 of them, and this without any
knowledge of their language.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The first who did
obtain a familiarity with it was Francisco de Toral,
afterwards first bishop of Yucatan. He described it
as most difficult, but nevertheless succeeded in reducing
it to rules and wrote an <i>Arte y Metodo</i> of it,
now unfortunately lost.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Its relationship has remained
obscure. De Laet asserted that it was merely
a corrupt dialect of the Nahuatl;<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> while Herrera was
informed by his authorities that it was a wholly different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
tongue.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> In this opinion he was right. In
1862 Dr. Berendt succeeded in obtaining a short
vocabulary of it as it is still spoken at Oluta, Tesistepec,
San Juan Volador and the neighboring country.
A comparison shows that it belongs to the Mixe
family. The ancient province of Tepeaca adjoined
directly the territory of the Mixes, and this identification
proves that their tongue was more important
and extended much more widely than has hitherto
been supposed. It was spoken, therefore, by the
Tlapanecos, Coviscas and Yopes, who were located
in this region.</p>

<p>The Popoloca of Oaxaca is an entirely different
tongue. It is mentioned as identical with the Chochona,
and some have supposed this dialect, in which
we have a <i>Catecismo</i> by Father Roldan, was the same
as the Popoloca of Tepeaca. This is an error. As I
have said, the first missionary to master and write
about the latter was Father Toral, who wrote his
<i>Arte</i> about 1561; but more than ten years before that,
to wit, in 1550, Father Benito Fernandez had printed
in the city of Mexico his <i>Doctrina en Lengua Misteca</i>,
and had composed variants in the Tepuzcolola
and Chochona dialects of that tongue.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The Chochona
or Popoloca, of Oaxaca, belongs to the Zapotec-Mixtec,
and not to the Zoque-Mixe family.</p>

<p>The Popolocas who lived in and near Michoacan
were also called Tecos, and Orozco y Berra enumerates
the language they spoke, the Teca, among those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
which are extinct.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The name <i>Tecos</i>, however, was
merely an abbreviated form of <i>Cuitlatecos</i>, and was
applied to the conquered Nahuatl population around
Michoacan. In some of the old glossaries <i>teco</i> is explained
by <i>Mexicano</i>.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The language they spoke
belonged to the Nahuatl branch of the Uto-Aztecan
stock.</p>

<p>The Popolocas of Guatemala were located at the
close of the eighteenth century in two curacies widely
apart.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> One of these was Yanantique, partido of San
Miguel, province of San Salvador, and contained the
villages Conchagua and Intipuca. Now Intipuca is
a Lenca name, as stated by Mr. Squier, and we are
thus authorized to identify these Popolocas with the
Lencas. The other Popolocas were at and near Conguaco
in the partido of Guazacapan, province of
Escuintla, where they lived immediately adjacent
to the Xincas. Dr. Otto Stoll identifies them with
the Mixes, but by an error, as he mistook the vocabulary
collected by Dr. Berendt of the Popoloca of
Oluta, for one of the Popoloca of Conguaco.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> What
language is spoken there I do not know, as I have not
been able to find a word in it in any of my authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Julius Scherzer has further added to the confusion
about the Popolocas of Guatemala by printing
at Vienna a vocabulary under this name which he
had obtained near the Volcan de Agua.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> It is nothing
more than the ordinary Cakchiquel dialect of
that locality, known as the <i>lengua metropolitana</i> from
its official adoption by the church.</p>

<h4>10. THE MAYAS.</h4>

<p>The geographical relations of the members of the
Maya stock are in marked contrast to those of the
Uto-Aztecan&mdash;its only rival in civilization. Except
the colony of the Huastecas on the shores of the Gulf
of Mexico in the valley of the Rio Panuco, all its
dialects were in contiguity. The true Maya, which
is believed to be the purest form of the language, extended
over the whole of the peninsula of Yucatan,
around Lake Peten, and far up the affluents of the
Usumacinta, the dialect of the Lacandons being
closely akin to it. The principal tribes in Guatemala
were the Quiches, the Cakchiquels and the Mams;
while in Tabasco the Tzendals and the Tzotzils held
an extensive territory. We cannot identify the builders
of the ruined cities of Palenque in Tabasco and
Copan in Honduras with the ancestors of any known
tribe, but the archæological evidence is conclusive
that whoever they were, they belonged to this stock,
and spoke one of its dialects.</p>

<p>The historic legends of several members of the
family have been well preserved. According to the
earliest authorities, those of the Quiches went back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
more than eight hundred years before the conquest,<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
that is, to about 700 A. D.; while the chronicles of
the Mayas seem to present a meagre sketch of the
nation nearly to the beginning of the Christian era.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
The uniform assertion of these legends is that the
ancestors of the stock came from a more northern
latitude, following down the shore of the Gulf of
Mexico. This is also supported by the position of
the Huastecas, who may be regarded as one of their
tribes left behind in the general migration, and by
the tradition of the Nahuas which assigned them a
northern origin.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> So far no relationship has been
detected with any northern stock, but the striking
similarity of some art remains in the middle Mississippi
to those of Yucatan, suggests that one should
search in this vicinity for their priscan home.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Physically the Mayas are short, strong, dark, and
brachycephalic. The custom of compressing the
skull antero-posteriorly which formerly prevailed,
exaggerated this latter peculiarity. When first encountered
by the Spaniards they were split into a
number of independent states of which eighteen are
enumerated in Yucatan alone. According to tradition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
these were the fragments of a powerful confederacy
which had broken up about a century before,
the capital of which was Mayapan. The tribes
were divided into gentes, usually named after
animals, with descent in the male line. A man bore
the names of both his father’s and mother’s gens,
but the former was distinguished as his “true name.”
The chieftainship was hereditary, a council from the
gentes deliberating with the ruler.</p>

<p>The art in which these people excelled was that of
architecture. They were born builders from a remote
epoch. At the time of the conquest the stately
structures of Copan, Palenque, T’Ho, and many
other cities were deserted and covered with an apparently
primitive forest; but others not inferior to them
Uxmal, Chichen Itza, Peten, etc., were the centers
of dense population, proving that the builders of both
were identical. The material was usually a hard
limestone, which was polished and carved, and imbedded
in a firm mortar. Such was also the character
of the edifices of the Quiches and Cakchiquels of
Guatemala. In view of the fact that none of these
masons knew the plumb-line or the square, the accuracy
of the adjustments is remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Their
efforts at sculpture were equally bold. They did not
hesitate to attempt statues in the round of life-size
and larger, and the facades of the edifices were covered
with extensive and intricate designs cut in high
relief upon the stones. All this was accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
without the use of metal tools, as they did not have
even the bronze chisels familiar to the Aztecs. Gold,
silver and copper were confined to ornaments, bells
and similar purposes.</p>

<p>The chief source of the food supply was agriculture.
Maize was the principal crop, and the arable
land was carefully let out to families by the heads of
the villages. Beans and peppers were also cultivated
and bees were domesticated, from which both honey
and wax, used in various arts, were collected. Cotton
was woven into fabrics of such delicacy that the
Spaniards at first thought the stuffs were of silk. It
was dyed of many colors, and was the main material
of clothing. Brilliant feathers were highly prized.
Their canoes were seaworthy, and though there was
no settlement of the Mayas on the island of Cuba as
has been alleged, there was a commercial interchange
of products with it, since Columbus was shown wax
from Yucatan and was told about the peninsula. An
active commerce was also maintained with southern
Mexico, along the Gulf Coast, the media of exchange
being cacao beans, shells, precious stones and flat
pieces of copper.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>The points which have attracted the most attention
in Maya civilization, next to its architecture, are the
calendar and the hieroglyphics. The calendar is
evidently upon the same basis as that of the Mexicans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
turning upon the numerals thirteen, twenty,
and four. But the Mayas appear to have had more
extended measures for the computation of time than
the Aztecs. Besides the cycle of twenty years, called
by them the <i>katun</i>, and that of fifty-two years, they
had the <i>ahau katun</i>, or Great Cycle, of two hundred
and sixty years.</p>

<p>Both the Cakchiquels, Quiches and Mayas of
Yucatan were literary peoples. They made frequent
use of tablets, wrote many books, and covered the
walls of their buildings with hieroglyphs carved on
the stone or wood, or painted upon the plaster.
Their characters are entirely different from those of
the Mexicans. Most of them have rounded outlines,
something like that of a section of a pebble, and for
this reason the name “calculiform” has been applied
to the writing. Their books were of maguey paper
or of parchment, folded like those of the Mexicans.
Although five or six of them have been preserved, as
well as numerous inscriptions on the walls of buildings,
no satisfactory interpretations have been offered,
largely, perhaps, because none of the interpreters
have made themselves familiar with the Maya language.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Imperfect description of the myths and rites of
the Yucatecan Mayas are preserved in the old Spanish
authors; while of the Quiches we have in the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
their sacred book, the <i>Popol Vuh</i> with a fair translation
by the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> This
may well be considered one of the most valuable
monuments of ancient American literature, and its
substantial authenticity cannot be doubted. Its first
part presents a body of ancient mythology and its
second the early history of the tribe. The latter is
supplemented by a similar document relating to the
history of their neighbors the Cakchiquels, written
at the time of the conquest, which I have published
from the unique MS. in my possession.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Many
facts relating to their ancient mythology, history and
superstitions were written down by educated natives
of Yucatan in a series of documents entitled “the
Books of Chilan Balam,” copies of a number of
which have been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> They are replete with
curious material.</p>

<h4>11. THE HUAVES, SUBTIABAS, LENCAS, XINCAS, XICAQUES,
“CARIBS,” MUSQUITOS, ULVAS, RAMAS,
PAYAS, GUATUSOS.</h4>

<p>The small tribe of the <i>Huaves</i> occupies four hamlets
on the isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Pacific
Ocean.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> The men are tall and strong but the women
are unusually ugly. Their occupation is chiefly fishing
and they have the reputation of being dull. The
language they speak is said to be of an independent
stock, and according to various writers the tribe
claims to have come from some part of the coast a
considerable distance to the south. The vocabularies
of their tongue are too imperfect to permit its identification.</p>

<p>The <i>Subtiabas</i> are inhabitants of the valley of that
name near the modern city of Leon in Nicaragua.
They were called Nagrandans by Mr. E. G. Squier,<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
because the site of ancient Leon was on the plain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Nagrando and the province also bore this name at the
time of the conquest. They are probably the descendants
of the ancient Maribois, whom both Oviedo
and Palacios place a few leagues from Leon and to
whom they ascribe an independent language; but it is
an error of some later writers to confound them with
the Chorotegans or Mangues, to whom they had no
relationship whatever. Their language stands by
itself among the inter-isthmian stocks.</p>

<p>The <i>Lenca</i> is spoken by several semi-civilized tribes
in central Honduras. Its principal dialects are the Intibucat,
Guajiquero, Opatoro and Similaton. It is an
independent stock, with no affinities as yet discovered.
The Guajiqueros dwell in remote villages in the San
Juan Mountains southwest of Comayagua, the capital
of Honduras. We owe to the late Mr. E. G. Squier
vocabularies of all four dialects and an interesting
description of the present condition of the stock.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>A little known tribe in a low stage of culture dwelt
on the Rio de los Esclavos, the <i>Xincas</i>. They extended
about fifty miles along the Pacific coast and
thence back to the Sierra which is there about the
same distance. The one vocabulary we have on their
tongue shows some loan words from their Nahuatl
neighbors the Pipiles, but in other respects it appears
to be a stock by itself. Its radicals are generally
monosyllabic, and the formation of words is by
suffixes.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The tribe was conquered by Alvarado, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
1524, who states that their principal village was at
Guazacapam. It was built of wood and populous.
There are some reasons for believing that previous to
the arrival of the Quiches and Cakchiquels on the
plains of Guatemala that region was occupied by this
nation, and that they gave way before the superior
fighting powers of the more cultured stock.</p>

<p>The <i>Xicaques</i> live in the state of Honduras to the
number of about six thousand. Their seats are on
the waters of the Rio Sulaque and Rio Chaloma.
They acknowledge one ruler, who is elective and
holds the office for life. Their language contains a
few Nahuatl words, but in the body of its vocabulary
reveals no relationship to any other stock.</p>

<p>The word <i>Carib</i> is frequently applied by the Spanish
population to any wild tribe, merely in the sense
of savage or wild. Thus on the upper Usumacinta
the Lacandons, a people of pure Maya stock, are so
called by the whites; on the Musquito coast the uncivilized
Ulvas of the mountains are referred to as
Caribs. There are a large number of pure and mixed
Caribs, probably five or six thousand, in British Honduras
near Trujillo, but they do not belong to the
original population. They were brought there from
the island of St. Vincent in 1796 by the British authorities.
Many of them have the marked traits of
the negro through a mingling of the races, and are
sometimes called “Black Caribs.” The Rev. Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Henderson, who has composed a grammar and
dictionary of their dialect, gives them the name
<i>Karifs</i>, a corruption of Carib, and is the term by
which they call themselves.</p>

<p>That portion of Honduras known as the Musquito
coast derived its name, not from the abundance of
those troublesome insects, but from a native tribe who
at the discovery occupied the shore near Blewfield
Lagoon. They are an intelligent people, short in
stature, unusually dark in color, with finely cut features,
and small straight noses&mdash;not at all negroid, except
where there has been an admixture of blood.
They number about six thousand, many of whom
have been partly civilized by the efforts of missionaries,
who have reduced the language to writing and
published in it a number of works. The Tunglas are
one of the sub-tribes of the Musquitos.</p>

<p>On the head-waters of the streams which empty
along the Musquito coast reside the numerous tribes
of the <i>Ulvas</i>, called by the English <i>Smoos</i>. These
are dark, but lighter in color than the Musquitos, and
are much ruder and more savage. The custom of
flattening the head prevails among them, and as their
features are not handsome at the best, and as they are
much afflicted with leprous diseases, they are by no
means an attractive people.</p>

<p>The <i>Ramas</i>, described as men of herculean stature
and strength, with a language of their own, reside on
a small island in Blewfield Lagoon.</p>

<p>Toward the mountains near the head-waters of
Black River, are the <i>Payas</i>, also alleged to be a separate
stock. But unfortunately we have no specimens
of these tongues.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>The upper waters of the Rio Frio and its affluents
form the locality of the <i>Guatusos</i> or Huatusos. By
some older writers these were supposed to be of
Nahuatl affinities, and others said that they were
“white Indians.” Neither of these tales has any
foundation. I have seen some of the Guatusos, and
their color is about that of the average northern Indians;
and as for their language, of which we have
rather full vocabularies, it is not in the slightest related
to the Nahuatl, but is an independent stock.
They are a robust and agile set, preferring a wild life,
but cultivating maize, bananas, tobacco and other
vegetables, and knitting nets and hammocks from
the fibres of the agave. The huleros, or gatherers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of india rubber, persecute them cruelly, and are correspondingly
hated. It is doubtful if at present they
number over six hundred.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>The mountain chain which separates Nicaragua
from Costa Rica, and the head-waters of the Rio Frio
from those of the more southern and eastern streams,
is the ethnographic boundary of North America. Beyond
it we come upon tribes whose linguistic affinities
point towards the southern continent. Such are
the Talamancas, Guaymies, Valientes and others,
which I must include, in view of recent researches
into their languages, in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="SOUTH_AMERICAN_TRIBES">SOUTH AMERICAN TRIBES.</h2>

<h3 id="GENERAL_REMARKS">GENERAL REMARKS.</h3>

<p>The linguistic classification of the South American
tribes offers far greater difficulties than that of
North America. Not only has it been studied less
diligently, but the geographical character of the interior,
the facilities with which tribes move along its
extensive water-ways, and the less stable temperament
of the white population have combined to obscure
the relationship of the native tribes and to limit our
knowledge about them.</p>

<p>The first serious attempt to take a comprehensive
survey of the idioms of this portion of the continent
was that of the Abbé Hervas in his general work on
the languages of the globe.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Balbi and Adelung did
scarcely more than pursue the lines he had traced in
this portion of the field. So little had these obtained
definite results that Alexander von Humboldt renounced
as impracticable the arrangement of South
American tribes by their languages, because “more
than seven-eighths would have remained what the
classifying botanists call <i>incertæ sedis</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>This eminent naturalist, however, overlooked no
opportunity to collect material for the study of the
native tongues, and on his return to Europe placed
what he had secured in the hands of his distinguished
brother for analysis. William von Humboldt, who
was the profoundest linguist of his day, gave close
attention to the subject, but rather from a purely
critical than an ethnographic aspect. He based upon
the South American languages many principles of
his linguistic philosophy; but so little general attention
was given the subject that his most valuable
study was first given to the press by myself in 1885.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Sixty years ago the French traveler, Alcide D’Orbigny,
published his important work devoted to
South American Ethnography, but confined to that
portion of the continent he had visited, south of the
parallel of 12° south latitude.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> His classification was
based partly on language, partly on physical traits,
and as it seemed simple and clear, it has retained its
popularity quite to the present day. He subsumes
all the tribes in the area referred to under three
“races,” subdivided into “branches” and “nations”
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In this classification, the distinctions of “races”
and “branches” are based exclusively on physical
characteristics, and are at times in conflict with a
linguistic arrangement. The Botocudos and Guaranis,
for instance, are wholly dissimilar and should
no more be classed together than the Peruvians and
the Tupis; the Saravecas and Paiconecas speak Arawak
dialects; and other examples could be cited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
When D’Orbigny confined himself to the identification
of related tribes by a close scrutiny of their
idioms, he rendered valuable service by introducing
order into the chaotic nomenclature of earlier writers,
as he forcibly points out; but his physical discriminations
are of little value.</p>

<p>About the middle of this century, two German
travelers, Von Tschudi and Von Martius, gave close
attention to the linguistic ethnology of the continent,
Von Tschudi in Peru and Von Martius in Brazil.
The former found the field so unoccupied that he did
not hesitate to write in a work published less than ten
years ago, “In fact, the knowledge of the languages
of South America is to-day less than it was two hundred
years ago.”<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> His own divisions of the linguistic
regions (<i>Sprachgebiete</i>) of the continent is less
satisfactory than we might expect. He describes
three principal and seven minor districts, the former
being, 1. The Pampo-Andean; 2. The inter-Andean;
and 3. The Tupi-Guarani regions. The minor centers
are, 1. The Arawak-Carib region; 2. That of
Cundinamarca; 3. The Rio Meta; 4. The Rio Tolima;
5. The Rio Atrato; 6. The Rio Salado; 7. The
Chaco; 8. That of the Moxos.</p>

<p>These are so far from meeting the requirements of
our linguistic possessions at present that scarcely one
of them can be accepted. Von Tschudi was an able
and critical scholar in his particular field, that of the
Kechua tongue, but he had not made a wide study of
South American languages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Von Martius was much more of a comparative linguist.
His work on the ethnography and linguistics
of South America<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> is a mine of general information,
and indispensable to every student of the subject.
Taking the numerous and confused dialects of Brazil,
and the almost hopeless synonymy of its tribal names,
he undertook a classification of them by establishing
verbal and grammatical similarities. It is now generally
recognized that he went too far in this direction.
He maintained, for instance, that there is a demonstrable
relationship between the Tupi, the Carib, and the
Arawak stocks; later studies have not endorsed this,
but have tended to show that they cannot be traced to
any common mother-speech. What Martius called the
“Guck” nations, which he brought into connection
through the word of that sound used by them to
designate the paternal uncle, are now considered to be
without general relationship. The researches of Karl
Von Den Steinen and Lucien Adam have overthrown
this theory.</p>

<p>It is especially in studying the vast and largely unexplored
regions watered by the upper streams of the
mighty Amazon, that one is yet at a loss to bring the
native inhabitants into ethnic order. Of the various
explorers and travellers who have visited that territory,
few have paid attention to the dialects of the
natives, and of those few, several have left their collections
unpublished. Thus, I have been unable to
learn that Richard Spruce, who obtained numerous
vocabularies along the Amazon and its branches, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
them to the press; and there were in the hands of
Von Tschudi more than a hundred vocabularies collected
by the German naturalist, Johannes Natterer,
in the interior of Brazil,<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> most of which I learn are
still in manuscript. In default of material such as this,
the classification of the tribes of Brazil must remain
imperfect.</p>

<p>It is also a matter of much regret that no copy can
be found of the work of the celebrated missionary,
Alonso de Barcena, <i>Lexica et Precepta in quinque Indorum
Linguis</i>, published at Lima, in 1590&mdash;if, indeed,
it was ever really printed. It contained grammars of
the Kechua, Aymara, Yunca, Puquina and Katamareña,
(spoken by the Calchaquis). Of the two last mentioned
idioms no other grammar is known, which makes the
complete disappearance of this early printed book
particularly unfortunate. Another Jesuit, Father
Guillaume D’Étré, wrote out the catechism and instructions
for the sacraments in eighteen languages of
eastern Peru and the upper Orinoco;<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> but this, too,
seems lost.</p>

<p>Of late years no one has paid such fruitful attention
to the relationship and classification of the South
American tribes and languages as M. Lucien Adam.
Although I have not in all points followed his nomenclature,
and have not throughout felt in accordance
with his grouping, I have always placed my main
dependence on his work in the special fields he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
selected&mdash;the three great South American families of
the Amazon region, the Arawak (called by him the
Maypure), the Carib, and the Tupi.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>The general plan which I shall adopt is rather for
convenience of arranging the subject than for reasons
based on similarities either of language or physical
habitus. It is that which allows the presentation of
the various stocks most in accordance with their geographic
distribution and their historic associations.</p>

<h3 id="I_THE_SOUTH_PACIFIC_GROUP">I. THE SOUTH PACIFIC GROUP.</h3>

<h4>1. THE COLUMBIAN REGION.</h4>

<p>This region includes the mountainous district in
northwestern South America, west of the basin
of the Orinoco and north of the equator&mdash;but without
rigid adherence to these lines. The character of its
culture differed considerably from that found in the
Atlantic regions and was much more closely assimilated
to that of Peru. Three lofty mountain chains
traverse New Granada from north to south, the intervening
valleys being beds of powerful rivers, rich in
fish and with fertile banks. This configuration of the
soil has exerted a profound influence on the life and
migrations of the native inhabitants, severing them
from the fellow-members of their race to the east and
directing their rovings in a north and south direction.</p>

<p>The productive valleys were no doubt densely populated;
though we must regard as a wild extravagance
the estimate of a modern writer that at the conquest
the native inhabitants of New Granada reached “six
to eight millions”<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>; and I hope that the historian
Herrera was far beyond the truth when he asserted
that in Popayan alone, in a single year fifty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of the Indians died of starvation, five thousand were
killed and eaten by the famishing multitude, and a
hundred thousand perished from pestilence!<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<h5><i>1. Tribes of the Isthmus and Adjacent Coast.</i></h5>

<p>At the discovery, the Isthmus of Panama was in the
possession of the <i>Cunas</i> tribe, as they call themselves.
They are the same to whom were applied later the
names Darien Indians (Wafer), Tules, Cunacunas,
Cuevas, Coybas, Mandingas, Bayanos, Irriacos, San
Blas Indians, Chucunacos, Tucutis, etc.</p>

<p>They extended from the Gulf of Uraba and the river
Atrato on the east to the river Chagres on the west.
In that direction they were contiguous to the Guaymis,
while on the right bank of the Atrato their neighbors
were the Chocos.</p>

<p>The Cunas are slightly undersized (about 1.50), but
symmetrical and vigorous. Their color is light, and
individuals with chestnut or reddish hair and grey
eyes have always been noted among them, and have
erroneously been supposed to be albinos. Their
skulls are markedly brachycephalic (88) and their faces
broad.</p>

<p>In spite of the severe measures of the Spaniards,
they have never been thoroughly reduced, and still
manifest an unconquerable love of freedom and a
wild life. When first met they lived in small villages
composed of communal houses, raised maize and cotton,
working the latter into garments for the women,
and possessed some gold, which they obtained from
the mountain streams and by working auriferous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
veins. The men usually appeared naked and used
poisoned arrows.</p>

<p>The Cuna language does not seem to be positively
connected with any other stock, nor have dialects of it
been discovered elsewhere. A number of verbal similarities
have been pointed out with the Chibcha, and
it has also a certain similarity to the Carib;<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> but with
our present knowledge it would be hasty to class it
along with any other.</p>

<p>The <i>Changuina</i> or Dorasque tribes of the Isthmus
lived latterly on the River Puan, a branch of the
Telorio, and are said to have numbered 5000 persons,
though but a few miserable remnants are surviving.
They are lighter in color than the Guaymis, with
whom they were in a constant state of quarreling.
In earlier times they were bold warriors, lived by
hunting, and were less cultured than their neighbors;
yet a remarkable megalithic monument in the pueblo
of Meza is attributed to them.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> At the period of the
conquest they dwelt in the high Sierras back of the
volcano of Chiriqui and extended to the northern
coast near Chiriqui Lagoon, where the River Changuina-Aula
(<i>aula</i>, in the Mosquito language, means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
river), still preserves their name. They were an independent
warlike tribe, and gave the Spaniards much
trouble. Finally, these broils led to their practical

died in 1882, and few others remain.</p>

<p>The <i>Chocos</i> were the first nation encountered in
South America on passing beyond the territory of the
Cunas. They occupied the eastern shore of the Gulf
of Uraba, and much of the lower valley of the Atrato.
Thence they extended westerly across the Sierra to
the Pacific coast, which they probably occupied from
the Gulf of San Miguel, in north latitude 8°, where
some of them still live under the name of Sambos,
down to the mouth of the San Juan River, about north
latitude 4°, on the affluents of which stream are the
Tados and Noanamas, speaking well-marked dialects
of the tongue. To the east they reached the valley of
the Cauca, in the province of Antioquia. The Tucuras,
at the junction of the Sinu and the Rio Verde, are
probably their easternmost branch.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Anthropologically, they resemble the Cunas, having
brachycephalic skulls, with large faces, but are rather
taller and of darker color. Here the resemblance
ceases, for they are widely dissimilar in language, in
customs and in temperament. Instead of being warlike
and quarrelsome, they are mild and peaceable;
they lived less in villages and communal houses than
in single isolated huts. Most of them are now
Catholics and cultivate the soil. They have little
energy and live miserably. At the time of the conquest
they were a trafficking people, obtaining salt
from the saline springs and gold from the quartz lodes,
which they exchanged with the tribes of the interior.
Some of them were skilful in working the metal, and
fine specimens of their products have been obtained
from their ancestral tombs.</p>

<p>It is worth while recording the names and positions
of the other native tribes along the northern coast at
the time of the discovery, even if we are unable to identify
their linguistic connections. An official report
made in 1546 furnishes a part of this information.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
At that time and previously the eastern shore of Venezuela
was peopled by the Chirigotos, who are probably
the Chagaragotos of later authors.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Their western
neighbors were the Caracas, near the present city of
that name. They were warlike, wove hamacs, poisoned
their arrows, and wore ornaments of gold. The
whole coast from Caracas to Lake Maracaibo was in
possession of the Caquetios, who also wove hamacs,
and dwelt in stationary villages. They were of
milder disposition and friendly, and as a consequence
were early enslaved and destroyed by the Spaniards.
Even at the date of the Relation they had disappeared
from the shore. It is possible that they fled far inland,
and gave their name in later days to the river
Caqueta.</p>

<p>Along the eastern border of Lake Maracaibo were
the Onotes, “The Lords of the Lagoon,” <i>Señores de
la Laguna</i>, a fine race, whose women were the
handsomest along the shore.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> They lived in houses
built on piles in the lake, and fished in its waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
with nets and hooks. They traded their fish for
maize and yuca to the Bobures. These dwelt on the
southern shore of the lake, and are distinguished as
erecting temples, <i>mesquites adoratorios</i>, for their religious
rites.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> The Sierra on the west of the lake
was the home of the warlike Coromochos.</p>

<p>These warriors probably belonged to the Goajiros,
who then, as now, occupied the peninsula on the
northwest of Lake Maracaibo.</p>

<p>It is not easy to say who were the Tirripis and
Turbacos, who lived about the mouth of the Magdalena
River, though the names remind us of the
Chibcha stock. Approaching the Gulf of Darien
from the east, we find the highlands and shores on
its west peopled by the Caimanes. These undoubtedly
belonged to the Cunas, as is proved by the words
collected among them in 1820 by Joaquin Acosta.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
The earliest linguistic evidence about their extension
dates from a report in 1515,<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> in which the writer says
that all along this coast, up to and beyond San Blas,
the natives call a man <i>uma</i> and a woman <i>ira</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
are words from the Cuna dialects.</p>

<p>In the mountainous district of Mérida, south of the
plains in the interior from Lake Maracaibo, there
still dwell the remains of a number of small bands
speaking dialects of a stock which has been called
from one of its principal members, the <i>Timote</i>. It
has been asserted to display a relationship to the
Chibcha, but the comparisons I have made do not reveal
such connection. It seems to stand alone, as an
independent tongue.</p>

<p>All the Timotes paid attention to agriculture, raising
maize, pepper and esculent roots of the potato
character. Those who lived in the warm regions
painted their bodies red and went naked; while those
in the uplands threw around them a square cotton
blanket fastened at the waist. Some of them buried
their dead in caves, as the Quindoraes on the banks
of the Motatan. With them they placed small figures
in terra cotta. The Mocochies, living where caves
are rare, built underground vaults for their dead,
closing the entrance with a great stone.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>From the writings of Lares and Ernst I make the
following list of the members of the</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Few of these names are found in the older writers.
In the Taparros we recognize the “Zaparas,” who,
in the last century, lived in contiguity to the Goajiros
of the adjacent peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The Mucuchis gave
their name to an early settlement of that name in the
province of Mérida.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The prefix <i>muco</i> or <i>moco</i>,
which is very common in place-names of that region,
is believed by Lares to have a locative significance.
Such names give approximately the extent of the
dialects at the settlement of the country.</p>

<p>In the highlands near the present city of Caracas,
and in the fertile valleys which surround the beautiful
inland lake of Valencia to the southeast, were at
the discovery a number of tribes whose names,
Arbacos, Mariches, Merigotos, etc., give us no information
as to their affinities. They are now extinct,
and nothing of their languages has been preserved.
All the more store do we set by the archæology
of the district, about which valuable information
has been contributed by Dr. G. Marcano.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> He
opened a number of burial mounds where the bones
of the dead, after having been denuded of flesh,
were interred, together with ornaments and utensils.
These were in stone, bone and terra cotta, the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
metal being gold in small quantity. The character
of the work showed the existence of a culture belonging
to the highest stage of polished stone. Many of
the skulls were artificially deformed to a high degree,
the frontal obliquity in some cases being double the
normal. Add to this that there was present an
almost unexampled prognathism, and we have crania
quite without similars in other parts of the continent.
When not deformed they were brachycephalic, and
both series gave a respectable capacity, 1470 c. c.</p>

<h5><i>2. The Chibchas.</i></h5>

<p>Most of the writers on the Chibchas have spoken
of them as a nation standing almost civilized in the
midst of barbarous hordes, and without affinities to
any other. Both of these statements are erroneous.
The Chibchas proper, or Muyscas, are but one member
of a numerous family of tribes which extended in
both directions from the Isthmus of Panama, and
thus had representatives in North as well as South
America. The Chibcha language was much more
widely disseminated throughout New Granada at the
time of the discovery than later writers have appreciated.
It was the general tongue of nearly all the
provinces, and occupied the same position with reference
to the other idioms that the Kechua did in
Peru.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Indeed, most of the tribes in New Granada
were recognized as members of this stock.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
were they so much above their neighbors in culture.
Many of these also were tillers of the soil, weavers
and spinners of cotton, diggers of gold in the quartz
lodes, skilled in moulding and hammering it into
artistic shapes, and known widely as energetic merchants.</p>

<p>No doubt the Chibchas had carried this culture to
the highest point of all the family. Their home was
on the southern confines of the stock, in the valleys
of Bogota and Tunja, where their land extended from
the fourth to the sixth degree of north latitude, about
the head-waters of the Sogamoso branch of the Magdalena.
Near the mouth of this river on its eastern
shore, rises the Sierra of Santa Marta, overlooking
the open sea, and continuing to the neck of the peninsula
of Goajira. These mountains were the home
time out of mind of the Aroacos, a tribe in a condition
of barbarism, but not distantly related in language
to the Chibchas.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards first undertook the conquest
of this Sierra, they met with stubborn resistance
from the Tayronas and Chimilas, who lived among
these hills. They were energetic tribes, cultivating
fields of maize, yucca, beans and cotton, which latter
they wove and dyed for clothing. Not only were
they versed in stratagems, but they knew some deadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
poison for their arrows.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>In later generations the Tayronas disappear entirely
from history, but I think the suggestion is well
founded that they merely became merged with the
Chimilas, with whom they were always associated,
and who still survive in the same locality as a
civilized tribe. We have some information about
their language.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> It shows sufficient affinity with the
Chibcha to justify me in classing the Tayronas and
Chimilas in that group.</p>

<p>An imperfect vocabulary of the native residents of
Siquisique in the state of Lara, formerly the province
of Barquisimetro, inclines me to unite them with the
Aroac branch of this stock, though their dialect is
evidently a mixed one.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>A still more interesting extension of this stock was
that which it appears to have had at one time in the
northern continent. A number of tribes beyond the
straits, in the states of Panama and Costa Rica, were
either filially connected or deeply influenced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
outposts of the Chibcha nation. These were the
Guaymis in Veraguas, who possessed the soil from
ocean to ocean, and the Talamancas of Costa Rica,
who in a number of small sub-tribes extended quite
to the boundaries of the present state of Nicaragua.
It has been recently shown, and I think on satisfactory
evidence, that their idioms contain a large number
of Chibcha words, and of such a class that they
could scarcely have been merely borrowed, but point
to a prolonged admixture of stocks.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Along with
these terms are others pointing to a different family
of languages, perhaps, as has long been suspected, to
some of the Carib dialects; but up to the present time
they must be said not to have been identified.</p>

<p>Thus Lucien Adam has pointed out that the two
groups of the Guaymi dialects differ as widely, as
follows:</p>

<p>Dr. Max Uhle, in a late essay, has collected numerous
verbal identities between the various Guaymi
and Talamanca dialects on the one hand, and the
Aroac and Chibcha on the other, including most of
the simple numerals and many words besides those
which would be likely to be introduced by commerce.
Not stopping with this, he has successfully developed
a variety of laws of vowel and consonant changes
in the dialects, which bring the resemblance of the
two groups into strong relief and do away with much
of their seeming diversity. Moreover, he points out
that the terminations of the present and imperative
are identical, and the placement of words in the sentence
alike in both. These and his other arguments
are sufficient, I think, to establish his thesis; and I
am at greater pains to set it forth, as I regard
it as one of unusual importance in its bearing on
the relations which existed in pre-historic times
between tribes along the boundary of the two continents.</p>

<p>As to the course of migration, I do not think that
the discussion of the dialectic changes leaves any room
for doubt. They all indicate attrition and loss of the
original form as we trace them from South into North
America; evidently the wandering hordes moved into
the latter from the southern continent. So far, there
is no evidence that any North American tribe migrated
into South America.</p>

<p>To illustrate these points I quote from Uhle’s tables

<p>The numerous relics which since 1859 have been
disinterred from the ancient sepulchres of Chiriqui
may be attributed to the members of this stock;
perhaps, as M. Pinart has suggested, to the ancestors
of the Guaymis, or, as Dr. Berendt thought, to the
Cunas or Coibas.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> These graves are scattered in
small groups or cemeteries, rarely more than ten acres
in extent, over the Pacific slope of the province of
Chiriqui. The similarity of the culture of their
makers to that of the Chibchas has not failed to impress
archæological experts. Thus, W. H. Holmes
remarks in his admirable article on the “Art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Chiriqui.” “In their burial customs, in the lack of
enduring houses or temples, and in their use of gold,
they were like the ancient peoples of middle and
southern New Granada.”<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>These relics are in stone, in pottery of many
varieties and forms, and in the metals gold, copper,
silver and tin in various alloys. So large was the
quantity of gold that from a single cemetery over
fifty thousand dollars in value have been extracted.
No wonder that Columbus and his companions gave
to this region the appellation <i>Castillo del Oro</i>, Golden
Castilé.</p>

<p>Such a condition of civilization is in accord with
the earliest descriptions of the Chiriqui tribes. When
in 1521 Francisco Compañon overran their country,
he found the Borucas and their neighbors living in
villages surrounded with high wooden palisades, the
posts firmly lashed together, making a solid wall of
defence.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>The culture of the Chibchas has been portrayed by
numerous writers, and it deserves to rank as next to
that of the Nahuas and Kechuas, though in many
respects inferior to both of these. Their chiefs held
by succession through the female side, the matriarchal
system prevailing throughout their tribes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Agriculture was diligently pursued, the products being
maize, potatoes, yucca and cotton. Artificial
irrigation by means of ditches was in extended use.
Salt was prepared on a large scale by evaporation, and
their skill in the manufacture of cotton cloth was
notable. Copper and bronze were unknown, and all
their tools and weapons were of wood and stone. In
this respect they were in arrears of their not distant
neighbors, the Kechuas. Gold, however, they had in
quantity, and knew how to smelt it and to work
it into vases and ornaments of actual beauty. The
use of stone for building was unknown, and their finest
structures were with wooden walls coated with clay
and roofed with straw.</p>

<p>In spite of what has sometimes been brought forward,
it is not likely that they had any method of
writing, and much that has been advanced about their
calendar is of doubtful correctness. They had neither
the quipos of the Peruvians nor the picture writing
of the Mexicans. The carved stones which have
sometimes been produced as a species of calendar
were probably merely moulds for hammering gold into
shape.</p>

<p>Quite a body of their mythologic legends have been
preserved, replete with interest to the student of the
religious sentiment of this race. They indicate an
active imagination and may be regarded as quite authentic.</p>

<p>The Chibchas proper, as well as the Aroacos, were
meso- or brachycephalic, the cephalic index ranging
above 80. They were of moderate stature, dark in
color, the face broad, the eyes dark and often slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
oblique, the cheek-bones prominent and the general

<h5><i>3. The Paniquitas and Paezes.</i></h5>

<p>A number of tribes living to the north and west of
the Chibchas seem to have belonged to one stock.
They are mentioned by the older historians as acting
in alliance, as in constant war with the Chibchas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and several of them as speaking dialects of a tongue
wholly different from the Chibchas. Their stage of
culture was lower, but they were acquainted with the
bow, the sling and the war-club, and had fixed habitations.
I give the list of these presumably related
tribes, and apply to the stock the name of one of the
modern tribes which retain the language.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<h6>PANIQUITA LINGUISTIC STOCK.</h6>

<div class="list-container">
<ul>
<li><i>Canapeis</i>, sub-tribe of Colimas (Herrera).</li>
<li><i>Colimas</i>, on the right bank of Magdalena, adjacent to the Musos.</li>
<li><i>Manipos</i>, adjacent to the Pijoas.</li>
<li><i>Musos</i>, on right bank of the Magdalena, adjacent and north of the Muyscas.</li>
<li><i>Nauras</i>, on the Rio Carari.</li>
<li><i>Paezes</i>, on the central Cordillera.</li>
<li><i>Panches</i>, on the east bank of Magdalena, near Tocayma.</li>
<li><i>Paniquitas</i>, between upper waters of the Magdalena and Cauca.</li>
<li><i>Pantagoros</i>, on both shores of the Magdalena and in province of Quimbaya.</li>
<li><i>Pijaos</i>, in Popayan, on the Cauca and Neyva.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>My reasons for identifying the modern Paniquitas
and Paezes with the ancient tribes named are, first,
the identity of the location, and secondly, the presence
of the initial syllable <i>pan</i> in the names of two of
the principal extinct peoples, a word which in Paniquita
means “mountain,” and clearly refers to the
position of their villages in the sierra, between the
head-waters of the Cauca and Magdalena Rivers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the references in the older writers, I may
mention that Herrera states that the language of the
Panches was one of the most extended in that part of
the country, and that the tribes speaking it almost
surrounded the Muyscas;<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and Piedrahita specifically
adds that the Pijaos, the most powerful tribe in
Popayan, whose territory extended from Cartago to
the city of Popayan, along the valley of the Neyva,
and quite to San Juan de los Llanos, belonged to the
same stock as the Pantagoros.</p>

<p>Some fragments have been preserved from the
mythology of the Musos, who lived about 24 leagues
northwest of Santa Fé, on the right bank of the
Magdalena. Their legends pointed for the home of
their ancestors to the left or western side of the river.
Here dwelt, lying in a position of eternal repose, the
Creator, a shadow whose name was <i>Are</i>. Ages ago he
carved for his amusement two figures in wood, a
man and a woman, and threw them into the river.
They rose from its waters as living beings, and
marrying, became the ancestors of the human
species.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Most of these tribes are reported to have flattened
artificially their heads, and to have burned the bodies
of their dead, or, in Popoyan, to have mummified
them by long exposure to a slow fire.</p>

<p>The Paezes live on both slopes of the central Cordillera,
across the valley of the Magdalena from
Bogota, some two thousand in number, in twenty-one
villages. They prefer the high altitudes, and are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
hardy set of hunters and mountaineers. In spite of
the cold they go nearly naked, but what is rare among
native Americans, they wear a hat of reeds or bark,
resembling in this some Peruvian tribes. Nor are
they devoid of skill in hammering gold into ornaments,
and weaving fibres of the maguey into mats
and cloths. One of their peculiar customs is to burn
down a house whenever a birth or a death takes place
in it. The harsh dialect they speak has been rendered
accessible by a publication of Señor Uricoechea.
Its practical identity with the Panequita is obvious
from the following comparison:<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<h5><i>4. South Columbian Tribes, Natives of Cauca, Coconucos,
Barbacoas, Andaquis, Mocoas, Cañaris.</i></h5>

<p>In the states of Cauca and Antioquia there are
scarcely any full-blood natives remaining, and the
tribes after the conquest were so shifted about that
it is difficult to know to which of them we should
attribute the abundant remains of ancient art which
are scattered profusely over this region. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
numerous sepulchral tumuli, especially in the Frontino
and Dabeiba districts, which yield a rich harvest
to the antiquary. They contain gold figures, vases
and ornaments, stone implements of uncommon perfection,
mirrors of polished pyrites, and small images
in stone and terra cotta. There are also remarkable
ruins in the valley of the Rio de la Plata, an affluent
of the upper Magdalena. They consist in colossal
statues rudely carved from stone, and edifices of the
same material, partly underground, the walls of large
slabs, and the roof supported by cylindrical carved
pillars. A few of these still remain intact, but the
majority have been wrecked by the earthquakes and
by the vandalism of treasure-hunters.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>In an attempt to restore the ancient ethnography
of this region, Dr. Posada-Arango thinks the former
tribes can be classed under three principal nations:<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>1. The <i>Catios</i>, west of the river Cauca.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Nutabes</i>, on the right bank of the Cauca, in its central course.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Tahamies</i>, toward the east and south.</p>

<p>In addition to these, there are the Yamacies, near
the present city of Saragossa.</p>

<p>According to the early records, these tribes lived in
fixed habitations constructed of wood and roofed with
thatch. They were cultivators of the soil, skilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in the manufacture of pottery and stone implements,
and had as domestic animals parrots and a small
species of dog (<i>perros de monte</i>). Their clothing was
of cotton, and they were much given to wearing
ornaments, many of which were of gold.</p>

<p>From the unfortunate absence of linguistic material,
I am unable to classify these interesting peoples.</p>

<p>In the valleys of the Sierra south of the Paezes
dwelt the <i>Guanucos</i>, described by the first explorers
as a warlike people in an advanced stage of culture.
Their houses were of stone, roofed with straw. The
sun was worshipped with elaborate ceremonies, including
choruses of virgins and the ministration of
thousands of priests.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The dead were buried and
the funeral solemnities associated with human sacrifice.
At present the neighbors of the Paezes on the
western slope of the Cordillera are the Moguexes or
Guambianos, partially civilized and carrying on a
rude agriculture. They are much given to dissolute
dances to the sound of the marimba, and to stupefying
themselves with stramonium, which they also use to
catch fish.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>The informant of the Abbé Hervas, Señor Velasco,
asserted that the Guanucos were a branch of the
<i>Coconucos</i>, who dwelt near the foot of the mountain
of that name in Popayan, and figure considerably in
some of the older histories.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Bollaert learned that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
some of them still survive, and obtained a few words
of their language, which he was also told was the
same as that of the Pubenanos.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> I have found by
comparison that it is identical with that of the
Moguexes and Totoros,<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and I am therefore enabled to
present the following group as members of what I
shall call the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<h6>COCONUCA LINGUISTIC STOCK.</h6>

<div class="list-container">
<ul>
<li><i>Coconucos</i>, at the sources of the Rio Purase.</li>
<li><i>Guanucos</i>, in the Sierra.</li>
<li><i>Guambianos</i>, see <i>Moguexes</i>.</li>
<li><i>Moguexes</i>, on the western slope of the Cordillera.</li>
<li><i>Pubenanos</i>, adjacent to the Coconucos.</li>
<li><i>Mosqueras</i>, sub-tribe of Moguexes.</li>
<li><i>Polindaras</i>, head-waters of Rio Cauca.</li>
<li><i>Totoros</i>, in the Sierra between the Magdalena and Cauca.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>To these should probably be added the Conchucos
and Guaycos, who appear to have been adjacent tribes
speaking the same tongue, although also being familiar
with the Kechua language.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>In the upper valleys of the rivers Daule, Chone
and Tachi, there still survive some families of the
“painted Indians,” who were referred to by Cieza de
Leon as Manivis, now usually called Colorados, but
whose own name is Sacchas, men or people. They
are naturally of a light yellow hue, some with light
hair and eyes, but are accustomed to go naked and
cover their skin with a reddish vegetable pigment,
which on the face is laid on in decorative lines.
Their language,<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> with which we have some acquaintance,
appears to belong to the same family as that of
the Barbacoas, to whom the Jesuit Father Luca della
Cueva went as missionary in 1640, and that of the Iscuandes
and the Telembis, all residing in the forests
near the coast, between 1° and 2° north latitude.
These are described by M. André, who visited them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
in 1880, as of mixed blood and reduced to a few hundreds,
but still retaining something of their ancient
tongue, of which he obtained a vocabulary of 23
words. The Cuaiqueres he reports as also speaking
this idiom.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>Velasco mentions that the Barbacoas, Telembis and
Iscuandes formed a confederation governed by a council
of nine members chosen equally from the three
tribes.</p>

<p>To the south of the Telembis and adjoining the
Kechua-speaking Malabas in the district of La Tola
were the Cayapas, of whom some remnants remain,
still preserving their native tongue. A vocabulary
of it, obtained by H. Wilcszynski, has recently been
published.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> On comparing it with the Colorado
vocabulary secured by Bishop Thiel and edited by
Dr. Seler, it is clear that they are dialects of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
stock, as will be seen from these examples:<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>The Cayapas are described as well-built, with oval
faces and roman noses.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>As the Barbacoas were the first known and probably
the most numerous member of this family, I
shall select their name to apply to them all, and classify
the group as follows:</p>

<h6>BARBACOA LINGUISTIC STOCK.</h6>

<div class="list-container">
<ul>
<li><i>Barbacoas</i>, on Upper Patia and Telembi.</li>
<li><i>Cayapas</i>, on coast near La Tola.</li>
<li><i>Colorados</i>, on Daule, Chone and Tachi Rivers.</li>
<li><i>Cuaiqueres</i>, on the coast about 1° N. Lat.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span><i>Iscuandes</i>, on Rio Patia.</li>
<li><i>Manivis</i>, head-waters of Rio Telembi.</li>
<li><i>Sacchas</i>, see <i>Colorados</i>.</li>
<li><i>Telembis</i>, on Rio Telembi.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>I have, in obedience to a sense of caution, treated
of this stock as separate from the Cocanuca; but the
fragmentary vocabularies at my command offer a
number of resemblances between the two, and I expect
that ampler material will show increased analogies,
probably to the extent of proving them branches
of the same family tree.</p>

<p>In the roughest part of the Eastern Cordillera,
about the head-waters of the two rivers Fragua,
(between 1° and 2° north latitude), live the <i>Andaquis</i>.
They are wild and warlike, and are the alleged
guardians of the legendary <i>Indeguau</i>, “House of the
Sun,” a cavern in which, according to local tradition,
lies piled the untold gold of the ancient peoples.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
At the time of the conquest their ancestors are said
to have occupied the fertile lands between the Magdalena
and Suaza rivers, especially the valley of San
Augustin, where they constructed mysterious cyclopean
edifices and subterranean temples, and carved
colossal statues from the living rock. These have been
described and portrayed by intelligent travelers, and
give us a high opinion of the skill and intelligence of
their builders.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>The only specimen I have found of the Andaqui
language is the vocabulary collected by the Presbyter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Albis. Its words show slight similarities to the
Paniquita and the Chibcha,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> but apparently it is at
bottom an independent stock. The nation was
divided into many sub-tribes, living in and along the
eastern Cordillera, and on the banks of the rivers
Orteguasa, Bodoquera, Pescado, Fragua and San
Pedro, all tributaries of the Caqueta.</p>

<p>The home of the <i>Mocoas</i> is between 1° and 2°
north lat. along the Rio de los Engaños or Yari,
(whence they are sometimes called Engaños or Inganos),
and other tributaries of the Caqueta.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> They
are partially civilized, and have seven or more villages
near the town of Mocoa. They are the first
natives encountered in descending the eastern slope
of the Cordillera. Unfortunately, we have a very
imperfect knowledge of their language, a few words
reported by the Presbyter Albis being all I have
seen. So many of them are borrowed from the Kechua,
that I have no means of deciding whether the
following list of the stock is correct or not:</p>

<h6>MOCOA LINGUISTIC STOCK.</h6>

<div class="list-container">
<ul>
<li><i>Almaguereños</i>.</li>
<li><i>Engaños</i> or <i>Inganos</i>.</li>
<li><i>Mesayas</i>.</li>
<li><i>Mocoas</i>.</li>
<li><i>Pastuzos</i>.</li>
<li><i>Patias</i> (?)</li>
<li><i>Sebondoyes</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Of these, the Patias dwelt on the lofty and sterile
plain between the two chains of the Cordilleras in
Popayan. The Sebondoyes had a village on the
Putumayo, five leagues south of the Lake of Mocoa
(Coleti).</p>

<p>The region around the Gulf of Guayaquil was conquered
by the Inca Tupac Yupanqui about 1450.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
The accounts say that it had previously been occupied
by some five-and-twenty independent tribes, all of
whom were brought under the dominion of the Kechuas
and adopted their language. The most prominent
of these were the <i>Cañaris</i>, whose homes were in
the hot valleys near the coast. Before the arrival of
the Incas they had a certain degree of cultivation,
being skilled in the moulding of copper, which they
worked with a different technique from the Kechuas.
Many of their copper axes are ornamented with
strange figures, perhaps totemic, cut into the metal.
As much as five or six hundred pounds’ weight of
these axes has been taken from one of their tombs.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
Some of the most beautiful gold work from the Peruvian
territory has been found in modern times in this
province, but was perhaps the work of Kechua rather
than of Cañari artists.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>The original language of the Cañaris, if it was other
than the Kechua, appears to have been lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<h4>2. THE PERUVIAN REGION.</h4>

<p>The difficulty of a linguistic classification of the
tribes of the Peruvian region is presented in very
formidable terms by the old writers. Cieza de Leon
said of this portion of the continent: “They have
such a variety of languages that there is almost a
new language at every league in all parts of the
country;”<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> and Garcilasso de la Vega complains of
the “confusion and multitude of languages,” which
gave the Incas so much trouble, and later so much
impeded the labors of the missionaries.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> An authority
is quoted by Bollaert to the effect that in the
vice-royalty of Quito alone there were more than
forty distinct tongues, spoken in upwards of three
hundred different dialects.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>Like most such statements, these are gross exaggerations.
In fact, from all the evidence which I
have been able to find, the tribes in the inter-Andean
valley, and on the coast, all the way from Quito,
under the equator, to the desert of Atacama in 25°
south latitude, belonged to probably four or at most
five linguistic stocks. These are the Kechua, the
Aymara, the Puquina, the Yunca, and the Atacameño.
Of these, the first three were known in the
early days of the conquest, as “the three general
languages”&mdash;<i>lenguas generales</i>&mdash;of Peru, on account
of their wide distribution. But it is quite likely, as
I shall show later, that the Aymara was a dialect, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
not an independent stock.</p>

<h5><i>1. The Kechuas.</i></h5>

<p>The Kechua in its various dialects, was spoken by
an unbroken chain of tribes for nearly two thousand
miles from north to south; that is, from 3° north of
the equator to 32° south latitude. Its influence can
be traced over a far wider area. In the dialects of
Popayan in Ecuador, in those on the Rio Putumayo
and Rio Napo, in those on the Ucayali and still
further east, on the banks of the Beni and Mamore, in
the Moxa of the Bolivian highlands, and southeast
quite to the languages of the Pampas, do we find
numerous words clearly borrowed from this widespread
stock.</p>

<p>This dissemination was due much more to culture
than to conquest. It was a tribute to the intellectual
superiority, the higher civilization, of this remarkable
people, as is evident by the character of the
words borrowed. It is a historic error to suppose
that the extension of the Kechua was the result of
the victories of the Incas. These occurred but a few
centuries before the arrival of the Spaniards, and
their influence was not great on the native tongues, as
even the panegyrist of the Incas, Garcilasso de la
Vega, confesses.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> The opinion of Von Tschudi was
so positive on this point that he says: “With a few
unimportant exceptions, wherever the Kechua was
spoken at the time of the conquest, it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
spoken thousands of years before the Inca dynasty
began.”<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> The assertion of Garcilasso de la Vega,
that the Inca gens had a language of its own, has
been shown to be an error.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>Where should we look for the starting-point, the
“cradle,” of the far-spread Kechua stock? The traditions
of the Incas pointed to the shores and islands
of Lake Titicaca as the birth-place of their remotest
ancestors; but as Markham has abundantly shown,
this was a pure myth. He himself is decidedly of the
opinion that we must search for the cradle of the stock
in the district of Cuzco, perhaps not far from Paucartambo,
“The House of the Dawning,” to which other
venerable Incarian legends assigned the scene of the
creation of their common ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>But there are many reasons, and to me satisfactory
ones, for believing that the first Kechuas appeared in
South America at the extreme north of the region
they later occupied, and that the course of their
migration was constantly from north to south. This
was also the opinion of the learned Von Tschudi.
He traces the early wandering of the Kechua tribes
from the vicinity of Quito to the district between the
Andes and the upper Marañon, thence in the direction
of Huaraz, and so gradually southward, following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the inter-Andean plateau, to the northern shore
of Lake Titicaca. There they encountered warlike
tribes who put a stop to their further progress in that
direction until the rise of the Inca dynasty, who
pushed their conquests toward the south and west.</p>

<p>The grounds for this opinion are largely linguistic.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
In his exhaustive analysis of the Kechua language,
Von Tschudi found its most archaic forms in the extreme
north, in the dialects of Quito and Chinchasuyu.
This is also my own impression from the comparison
of the northern and southern dialects. For instance,
in the Chinchaya (northern), the word for water is
<i>yacu</i>, while the southern dialects employ <i>yacu</i> in the
sense of “flowing water,” or river, and for water in
general adopted the word <i>unu</i>, apparently from the
Arawak stock. Now, as Karl von den Steinen argues
in a similar instance, we can understand how a river
could be called “water,” but not how drinking water
could be called “river;” and therefore we must assume
that the original sense of <i>yacu</i> was simply
“water,” and that the tribes who retained this
meaning had the more archaic vocabulary.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Markham indeed says: “In my opinion there
is no sufficient evidence that the people of Quito did
speak Quichua previous to the Inca conquest;” and
he quotes Cieza de Leon to the effect that at the time
of the Spanish conquest they had a tongue of their
own.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> I have, however, shown how untrustworthy
Cieza de Leon’s statements are on such subjects;
and what is conclusive, there were Kechua-speaking
tribes living at the north who never were subjugated
by the Incas. Such for instance were the Malabas,
whom Stevenson, when visiting that region in 1815,
found living in a wild state on San Miguel river, a
branch of the Esmeraldas.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> This is also true, according
to the observations of Stübel, of the natives
of Tucas de Santiago in the province of Pasto in
Ecuador.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>This opinion is further supported by a strong consensus
of ancient tradition, which, in spite of its
vagueness, certainly carries some weight. Many of
the southern Kechua tribes referred for their origin
to the extreme northwest as known to them, to the
ancient city of Lambayeque on the Pacific coast, a
locality which, according to Bastian,<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> held a place in
their traditions equivalent to that of Culiacan, “the
Home of the Ancestors,” in the legendary lore of the
Aztecs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>The legends of the ancient Quitus have been preserved
in the work of Juan de Velasco, and although
they are dismissed with small respect by Markham, I
am myself of the opinion that there is both external
and internal evidence to justify us in accepting them
as at least genuine native productions. They relate
that at a remote epoch two Kechua-speaking tribes,
the Mantas on the south, and the Caras on the north,
occupied the coast from the Gulf of Guayaquil to the
Esmeraldas River. The Caras were the elder, and its
ancestors had reached that part of the coast in rafts
and canoes from some more northern home. For
many generations they remained a maritime people,
but at length followed up the Esmeraldas and its
affluents until they reached the vicinity of Quito,
where they developed into a powerful nation under
the rule of their <i>scyri</i>, or chiefs. Of these they
claimed a dynasty of nineteen previous to the conquest
of their territory by the Inca Huayna Capac.
They inherited in the male line, and were monogamous
to the extent that the issue of only one of
their wives could be regarded as legal heirs.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> They
did not bury their dead, as did the southern Kechuas,
but placed them on the surface of the soil and constructed
a stone mound or tomb, called <i>tola</i>, over the
remains, resembling in this the Aymaras.</p>

<p>The extent of the Kechua tongue to the north has
not been accurately defined. Under the name <i>Yumbos</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
or <i>Yumbos de Guerra</i>, the old Relations included
various tribes in the Quito region who had not been
reduced by the Spanish Conquistadores.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> A recent
traveler, M. André, states that the Yumbos belong to
the family of the Quitus, and include the tribes of
the Cayapas, Colorados and Mangaches.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Of these,
the Cayapas and Colorados, as I have shown, belong
to the Barbacoa stock, though the term <i>Colorados</i>
“painted,” is applied to so many tribes that it is not
clear which is meant. The geographer Villavicencio
observes that “the Napos, Canelos, Intags, Nanegales
and Gualeas, collectively called Yumbos, all
speak dialects of the Kechua.” The modern Canelos
he describes as a cross between the ancient Yumbos
and the Jivaros, to whom they are now neighbors,
while the modern Quitos adjoin the Zaparos. Their
language, however, he asserts, has retained its purity.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>Whether we should include in this stock the Macas,
who dwell on the eastern slope of the Andes a
few degrees south of the equator, is not clear, as I
have found no vocabularies. Velasco refers to them
as a part of the Scyra stock, and they are in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Kechua region. Mr. Buckley, who visited them a
few years ago, describes them as divided into small
tribes, constantly at war with each other. Their
weapons are spears and blow-pipes with poisoned
arrows. Hunting is their principal business, but they
also raise some maize, yucca and tobacco. Polygamy
prevails along with the patriarchal system, the son
inheriting the property of his father. Some rude pottery
is manufactured, and their huts of palm leaves are
neatly constructed. Like the Jivaros, they prepare
the heads of the dead, and sometimes a man will kill
one of his wives if he takes a fancy that her head
would look particularly ornamental thus preserved.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The southern limit of the Kechua tongue, before
the Spanish conquest, has been variously put by
different writers; but I think we can safely adopt
Coquimbo, in south latitude 30°, as practically the
boundary of the stock. We are informed that in
1593 the priests addressed their congregations in
Kechua at this place,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> and in the same generation
the missionary Valdivia names it as the northern
limit of the Araucanian.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Doubtless, however, it
was spoken by outlying colonies as far south as the
river Maule, in south latitude 35°, which other
writers assign as the limit of the conquests of the
Incas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Cieza de Leon and other early Spanish writers
frequently refer to the general physical sameness of
the Peruvian tribes. They found all of them somewhat
undersized, brown in color, beardless, and of
but moderate muscular force.</p>

<p>The craniology of Peru offers peculiar difficulties.
It was the policy of the rulers to remove large numbers
of conquered tribes to distant portions of the realm in
order to render the population more homogeneous.
This led to a constant blending of physical traits.
Furthermore, nowhere on the continent do we find
skulls presenting more grotesque artificial deformities,
which render it difficult to decide upon their normal
form. When the latter element is carefully excluded,
we still find a conflicting diversity in the results of
measurements. Of 245 Peruvian crania in the collection
of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia,
168 are brachycephalic, 50 are dolichocephalic,
and 27 mesocephalic. Of 13 from near Arica, all but
one are dolichocephalic. Of 104 from Pachacamac,
93 are brachycephalic and none dolichocephalic. It
is evident that along the coast there lived tribes of
contrasted skull forms. From the material at hand I
should say that the dividing line was near Pisco,
those south of that point having elongated, those
north of it rounded heads. The true Kechuas and
Aymaras are meso or brachycephalic. The crania
from the celebrated cemetery of Ancon, which is
situated on the coast near Lima, are mostly deformed,
but when obtained in natural form prove
the population to have been mesocephalic, with
rounded orbits (megasemes) and narrow prominent
noses (leptorhines). An average of six specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
yielded a cubical capacity of 1335 cub. cent.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>The cubical capacity of the Peruvian skulls from
the coast generally averages remarkably low&mdash;lower
than that of the Bushmen or Hottentots. Careful
measurements give the capacity at 1230 cubic centimeters.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
They almost reach the borders of microcephaly,
which Broca placed at 1150 cubic centimeters.</p>

<p>Although the Spanish writers speak of the Inca as
an autocratic despot, a careful analysis of the social
organization of ancient Peru places it in the light of
a government by a council of the gentes, quite in accordance
with the system so familiar elsewhere on the
continent. The Inca was a war-chief, elected by the
council as an executive officer to carry out its decision,
and had practically no initiative of his own.
Associated with him, and nearly equal in power, was
the <i>huillac huma</i>, or “speaking head,” who acted as
president of the tribal council, and was the executive
officer in the Inca’s absence. The totemic system
still controlled the social life of the people, although
it is evident that the idea of the family had begun to
assert itself. The land continued to be owned by the
gens or <i>ayllu</i>, and not by individuals.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Agriculture had reached its highest level in Peru
among the native tribes. The soil was artificially
enriched with manure and guano brought from the
islands; extensive systems of irrigation were carried
out, and implements of bronze, as spades and hoes,
took the place of the ruder tools of stone or wood.
The crops were maize, potatoes both white and
sweet, yucca, peppers, tobacco and cotton. Of domestic
animals the llama and paco were bred for their
hair, for sacrifices and as beasts of burden, but not for
draft, for riding nor for milking.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The herds often
numbered many thousands. The Inca dog was a descendant
of the wolf,<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> and monkeys, birds and guinea
pigs were common pets.</p>

<p>Cotton and hair of the various species of the llama
were spun and woven into a large variety of fabrics,
often ornamented with geometric designs in color.
The pottery was exceedingly varied in forms. Natural
objects were imitated in clay with fidelity and
expression, and when a desirable model was not at
hand, the potter was an adept in moulding curious
trick-jars that would not empty their contents in the
expected direction, or would emit a strange note from
the gurgling fluid, or such as could be used as
whistles, or he could turn out terra-cotta flutes and
the like. Not less adroit were the artists in metal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
especially in bronze and in gold and silver. The
early writers are filled with expressions of astonishment
at the amount, variety and beauty of the
Incarian gold work. Its amount we may well credit
when we are told that the value of the precious
metals shipped to Spain within twenty-five years
after the conquest was four hundred million ducats of
gold. There are specimens enough remaining to judge
of its artistic designs. They are quite ingenious and
show dexterous manipulation, but rarely hint at a
sense of the beautiful.</p>

<p>Peruvian architecture was peculiar and imposing.
It showed no trace of an inspiration from Yucatan or
Mexico. Its special features were cyclopean walls of
huge stones fitted together without mortar; structures
of several stories in height, not erected upon tumuli
or pyramids; the doors narrowing in breadth toward
the top; the absence of pillars or arches; the avoidance
of exterior and mural decoration; the artistic
disposition of niches in the walls; and the extreme
solidity of the foundations. These points show that
Inca architecture was not derived from that north of
the isthmus of Panama. In the decorative effects of
the art they were deficient; neither their sculpture in
stone nor their mural paintings at all equalled those
of Yucatan.</p>

<p>The only plan they had devised to record or to recall
ideas was by means of knotted strings of various
colors and sizes, called quipus. These could have
been nothing more than mere mnemonic aids, highly
artificial and limited in their application.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The official religion was a worship of the sun; but
along with it were carried the myths of Viracocha, the
national hero-god, whom it is not difficult to identify
with the personifications of light so common in
American religions. The ceremonies of the cult
were elaborate, and were not associated with the
bloody sacrifices frequent in Yucatan and Mexico.
Their mythology was rich, and many legends were
current of the white and bearded Viracocha, the culture
hero, who gave them their civilization, and of
his emergence from the “house of the dawn.” According
to some authorities which appear to be trustworthy,
the more intelligent of the Kechuas appear
to have risen above object-worship, and to have
advocated the belief in a single and incorporeal
divinity.</p>

<p>A variety of ancestral worship also prevailed, that
of the <i>pacarina</i>, or forefather of the <i>ayllu</i> or gens,
idealized as the soul or essence of his descendants.
The emblem worshipped was the actual body, called
<i>malqui</i>, which was mummied and preserved with
reverential care in sacred underground temples.</p>

<p>The morality of the Peruvians stood low. Their
art relics abound in obscene devices and the portraiture
of unnatural passions. We can scarcely err in
seeing in them a nation which had been deteriorated
by a long indulgence in debasing tastes.</p>

<p>The Kechua language is one of harsh phonetics,
especially in the southern dialects, but of considerable
linguistic development. The modifications of
the theme are by means of suffixes, which are so
numerous as to give it a flexibility and power of conveying
slight shades of meaning rare in American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
tongues, and which Friedrich Müller compares to
that of the Osmanli Turks.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Its literature was by no
means despicable. In spite of the absence of a
method of writing, there was a large body of songs,
legends and dramas preserved by oral communication
and the quipus. A number of these have been published.
Among them the drama of <i>Ollanta</i> is the
most noteworthy. It appears to be a genuine aboriginal
production, committed to writing soon after
the conquest, and bears the marks of an appreciation
of literary form higher than we might have expected.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
The poems or <i>yaraveys</i>, usually turn on
love for a theme, and often contain sentiments of
force and delicacy.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Several excellent grammatical
studies of the Kechua have appeared in recent years.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<h5><i>2. The Aymaras.</i></h5>

<p>I have thought it best to treat of the Aymara as a
distinct linguistic stock, although the evidence is
steadily accumulating that it is, if not merely a
dialect of the Kechua, then a jargon made up of the
Kechua and other stocks. In the first place, the
name “Aymara” appears to have been a misnomer,
or, as Markham strongly puts it, a “deplorable blunder,”
of the Jesuit missionaries stationed at Juli.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
The true Aymaras were an unimportant <i>ayllu</i> or gens
of the Kechuas, and lived in the valley of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Abancay, hundreds of miles from Juli. A number of
them had been transported to Juli to work in the
mines, and there had intermarried with women of
the Colla and Lupaca tribes, native to that locality.
The corrupt dialect of the children of these Aymara
colonists was that to which the Jesuit, Ludovico Bertonio,
gave the name Aymara, and in it, Markham
claims, he wrote his grammar and dictionary.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>Its grammar and phonetics are closely analogous to
those of the southern Kechua dialects, and about one-fourth
of its vocabulary is clearly traceable to Kechua
radicals. Moreover, the Colla, Lupaca, Pacasa and
allied dialects of that region are considered by various
authorities as derived from the Kechua. For these
reasons, Markham, Von Tschudi, and later, Professor
Steinthal, have pronounced in favor of the opinion
that the so-called Aymara is a member of the Kechua
linguistic stock.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the decided majority of its
radicals have no affinity with Kechua, and betray a
preponderating influence of some other stock. What
this may have been must be left for future investigation.
It does not seem to have been the Puquina;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
for although that tongue borrowed from both the
Aymara and the pure Kechua dialects, its numerals
indicate a stock radically apart from either of them.</p>

<p>The Aymara was spoken with the greatest purity
and precision by the Pacasas; and next to these, by
the Lupacas; and it was especially on these two
dialects that Bertonio founded his Grammar, and not
upon the mongrel dialect of the imported laborers, as
Markham would have us believe.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>The physical traits of the Aymara Indians offer
some peculiarities. These consist mainly in an unusual
length of the trunk in proportion to the height,
in a surprising development of the chest, and short
extremities. The proportion of the thigh to the leg
in length is under the average. The leg and calf are
well developed, and the general muscular force good.
The hands and feet are smaller even than is common
in the American race. The skull has a tendency to
dolichocephaly.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> The unusual thoracic development
is plainly attributable to the tenuity of the atmosphere
breathed by these residents of heights varying from
4,000 to 17,000 feet above sea level. Making allowances
for the results of this exposure, they do not
differ materially from the general physical habits of
the Kechuas.</p>

<p>The location they occupied was generally to the
south and east of the Kechuas, upon the plateau and
western slopes of the Andes, from south latitude 15°
to 20°, and through about six degrees of longitude.
It may be said roughly to have been three hundred
miles from north to south, and four hundred from
east to west. The total native population of this area
to-day is about six hundred thousand, two-thirds of
whom are of pure blood, and the remainder mixed.
Some of them dwell along the sea coast, but the
majority are on the Bolivian plateau, the average altitude
of which is more than twelve thousand feet
above sea level.</p>

<p>The old writers furnish us very little information
about the Aymaras. At the time of the discovery
they were subject to the Kechuas and had long been
thus dependent. Many, however, believe that they
were the creators or inspirers of the civilization which
the Kechuas extended so widely over the western
coast. Certain it is that the traditions of the latter
relate that their first king and the founder of their
higher culture, Manco Capac, journeyed northward
from his home on the shores of Lake Titicaca, which
was situated in Aymara territory. From the white
foam of this inland sea rose the Kechua culture-hero
Viracocha, who brought them the knowledge of useful
arts and the mysteries of their cult.</p>

<p>On the cold plain, higher than the summit of the
Jungfrau, which borders this elevated sea are also
found the enigmatical ruins of Tiahuanuco, much
the most remarkable of any in America. They are
the remains of imposing edifices of stone, the cyclopean
blocks polished and adjusted so nicely one to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the other that a knife-blade cannot be inserted in the
joint.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> In architectural character they differ widely
from the remains of Incarian structures. The walls
are decorated with bas-reliefs, there are remains of
columns, the doors have parallel and not sloping
sides, all angles are right angles, and large statues in
basalt were part of the ornamentation. In these respects
we recognize a different inspiration from that
which governed the architecture of the Kechuas.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>No tradition records the builders of these strange
structures. No one occupied them at the time of the
conquest. When first heard of, they were lonely
ruins as they are to-day, whose designers and whose
purposes were alike unknown. The sepulchral
structures of the Aymaras also differed from those of
the Incas. They were not underground vaults, but
stone structures erected on the surface, with small
doors through which the corpse was placed in the
tomb. They were called <i>chulpas</i>, and in construction
resembled the <i>tolas</i> of the Quitus. Sometimes
they are in large groups, as the <i>Pataca Chulpa</i>,
“field of a hundred tombs,” in the province of
Carancas.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<h5><i>3. The Puquinas.</i></h5>

<p>The Puquinas are also known under the names
Urus or Uros, Hunos and Ochozomas. They formerly
lived on the islands and shores of Lake Titicaca,
in the neighborhood of Pucarini, and in several
villages of the diocese of Lima. Oliva avers that
some of them were found on the coast near Lambayeque.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
If this is correct, they had doubtless been
transported there by either the Incas or the Spanish
authorities. They are uniformly spoken of as low in
culture, shy of strangers and dull in intelligence.
Acosta pretends that they were so brutish that they
did not claim to be men.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Garcilasso de la Vega
calls them rude and stupid.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Alcedo, writing in the
latter half of the eighteenth century, states that those
on the islands had, against their will, been removed
to the mainland, where they dwelt in gloomy caves
and in holes in the ground covered with reeds, and
depended on fishing for a subsistence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>They are alleged to have been jealous about their
language, and unwilling for any stranger to learn it.
Their religious exercises were conducted in Kechua,
with which they were all more or less acquainted.
The only specimen of their tongue in modern treatises
is the Lord’s Prayer, printed by Hervas and
copied by Adelung.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> On it Hervas based the opinion
that the Puquina was an independent stock. The
editors of the “Mithridates” seemed to incline to the
belief that it was related to the Aymara, and this
opinion was fully adopted by Clement L. Markham,
who pronounced it “a very rude dialect of the Lupaca,”<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
in which he was followed by the learned
Von Tschudi.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>None of these authorities had other material than
the <i>Pater Noster</i> referred to. Hervas credits it to a
work of the missionary Geronimo de Ore, which it is
evident that neither he nor any of the other writers
named had ever seen, as they all speak of the specimen
as the only printed example of the tongue.
This work is the <i>Rituale seu Manuale Peruanum</i>,
published at Naples in 1607. It contains about
thirty pages in the Puquina tongue, with translations
into Aymara, Kechua, Spanish and Latin, and thus
forms a mine of material for the student. Though
rare, a copy of it is in the Bibliothèque Nationale at
Paris, and is thus readily accessible. I have published
a number of extracts from its Puquina renderings
in the <i>Proceedings of the American Philosophical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Society</i> for 1890. They are sufficient to show that
while this language borrowed many terms, especially
those referring to religion and culture, from the
neighboring Kechua and Aymara dialects, these were
but additions to a primitive stock fundamentally different
from either of them.</p>

<p>The dissimilarity of the three tongues is well seen
in their numerals, which are as follows:</p>

<p>In these lists the Aymara numerals, <i>one</i>, <i>two</i> and
<i>four</i> are independent; <i>three</i>, <i>five</i>, <i>six</i> and <i>ten</i> are
taken from the Kechua; and the remaining three are
compound, <i>pa-callco</i>, being 2+5; <i>quimsa-callco</i>, 3+5;
and <i>llalla-tunca</i> meaning “less than ten.” <i>Callco</i>
is derived from the word for “foot,” the counting
being with the toes. On the other hand, there is not
a single numeral in the Puquina which can be derived
from either Kechua or Aymara; and what is more
remarkable, there is apparently not one which is
compounded.</p>

<p>It remains puzzling to me why the Puquina, which
seems to have been spoken only by a few wretched
villagers about Lake Titicaca, should have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
classed by writers in the sixteenth century as one of
the <i>lenguas generales</i> of Peru. Not only does Ore
refer to it by this term, but in one of the official
<i>Relaciones Geograficas</i> written in 1582, it is mentioned
as “one of the three general languages of this
kingdom.”<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> This would seem to indicate that at
that period it had a wider extension than we can now
trace.</p>

<h5><i>4. The Yuncas.</i></h5>

<p>The Yuncas occupied the hot valleys near the sea
between south latitude 5° and 10°, their capital being
in the vicinity of the present city of Truxillo. Their
tongue belongs to an entirely different stock from the
Kechua, and was not influenced by it. It still survives
in a few sequestered valleys. The extreme difficulty
of its phonetics aided to prevent its extension.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>There is little doubt but that the Yuncas immigrated
to their locality at some not very distant
period before the conquest. According to their own
traditions their ancestors journeyed down the coast in
their canoes from a home to the north, until they
reached the port of Truxillo.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Here they settled
and in later years constructed the enormous palace
known as the <i>Gran Chimu</i>, whose massive brick
walls, spacious terraces, vast galleries and fronts
decorated with bas-reliefs and rich frescoes, are still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the wonder and admiration of travelers.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>Near by, in the valley of Chicama and vicinity, they
constructed capacious reservoirs and canals for irrigation
which watered their well-tilled fields, and were
so solidly constructed that some of them have been
utilized by enterprising planters in this generation.
Doubtless some of these were the work of the Incas
after their conquest of this valley by the Inca Pachacutec,
as is related by Garcilasso de la Vega,<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> but the
fact that the Chimus were even before that date
famed for their expertness in the working of metals
and the fashioning of jewels and vases in silver and
gold,<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> proves that they did not owe their culture to
the instruction of the Quichuas.</p>

<p>The term <i>yunca-cuna</i> is a generic one in the Kechua
language, and means simply “dwellers in the
warm country,” the <i>tierra caliente</i>, near the sea
coast. It was more particularly applied to the Chimus
near Truxillo, but included a number of other
tribes, all of whom, it is said, spoke related dialects.
Of the list which I append we are sure of the Mochicas
or Chinchas, as the Yunca portion of Geronimo
de Ore’s work is in this dialect;<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> of the Estenes,
Bastian has printed quite a full vocabulary which is
nearly identical with the Yunca of Carrera;<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Mr.
Spruce obtained in 1863 a vocabulary of forty words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
from the Sechuras, proving them to belong to this
stock;<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> but the dialects of the Colanes and Catacoas
are said by the same authority to be now extinct.
According to the information obtained by the Abbé
Hervas, the “Colorados of Angamarca” also spoke
a Yunca dialect,<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> but I have been unable to identify
this particular tribe of “painted” Indians.</p>

<p>The location of the stock at the conquest may be
said to have been from south lat. 4° to 10°; and to
have included the three departments of modern Peru
called Ancachs, Libertad, and Piura.</p>

<h5><i>5. The Atacameños and Changos.</i></h5>

<p>In the valley of the river Loa, about 20°-23° south
latitude, and in the vicinity of Atacama, there still
survive remnants of a tribe called Atacameños by
the Spaniards, but by themselves <i>Lican-Antais</i>, people
of the villages. Their language appears to be of
an independent stock, equally remote from that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the Kechuas and the Aymaras. Vocabularies of it
have been preserved by various travelers, and the outlines
of its grammar have been recently published by
San-Roman.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> From two of its numerals and some
other indications Dr. Darapsky has connected it with
the Aymara, which is also spoken in that vicinity.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
The relationship, however, cannot be considered established,
and the latest researches tend to sharpen
the contrast between the <i>Cunza</i>, as it is sometimes
called, and the Aymara.</p>

<p>The Lican-antais are fishermen and live in a condition
of destitution. The aridity of the climate is
unfavorable to agriculture. In physical habitus they
are short, with dark complexions, flat broad noses and
low foreheads.</p>

<p>D’Orbigny identifies the Lican-Antais with the
Olipes, Lipes or Llipis of the older writers<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> (Garcilasso,
etc). This, however, is open to doubt. Von
Tschudi hazarded the opinion that the Atacameños
were a remnant of the Calchaquis of Tucuman, who
had sought refuge from the Spaniards in this remote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
oasis on the coast.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> I can find no positive support
for this view, as we have no specimens of the language
of the Calchaquis.</p>

<p>Immediately to the south of the Atacameños, bordering
upon the sterile sands of the desert of Atacama,
between south latitude 22° and 24°, are the
<i>Changos</i>. In their country it never rains, and for
food they depend entirely on the yield of the sea, fish,
crustacea and edible algae. Like the Bushmen of the
Kalihari desert, and doubtless for the same reason of
insufficient nutrition, they are undersized, as a tribe
perhaps of the shortest stature of any on the continent.
The average of the males is four feet nine
inches, and very few reach five feet.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> They are, however,
solidly built and vigorous. The color is dark,
the nose straight and the eyes horizontal.</p>

<p>Nothing satisfactory is reported about their language,
which is asserted to be different from the
Aymara or any other stock. The tribe has been confounded
by some writers with the Atacameños, and
the Spaniards apparently included both under the
term <i>Changos</i>; which is at present used as a term of
depreciation. But both in location and appearance
they are diverse. Whether this extends also to language,
as is alleged, I have not the material to determine,
and probably the tongue is extinct.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<h3 id="II_THE_SOUTH_ATLANTIC_GROUP">II. THE SOUTH ATLANTIC GROUP.</h3>

<h4>1. THE AMAZONIAN REGION.</h4>

<p>Those two mighty rivers, the Amazon and the
Orinoco, belong to one hydrographic system, the
upper affluents of the latter pouring their waters for
six months of the year into the majestic expanse of
the former. Together they drain over three million
square miles of land,<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> clothed throughout with
lush tropical vegetation and seamed by innumerable
streams, offering natural and facile paths of intercommunication.
It is not surprising, therefore, that
we find linguistic stocks extended most widely over
this vast area, each counting numerous members.
Of them the most widely disseminated were the Tupi,
the Tapuya, the Carib and the Arawak families, and
to these I shall first give attention.</p>

<h5><i>1. The Tupis.</i></h5>

<p>Along the coast of Brazil and up the Amazon there
is current a more or less corrupted native tongue
called the “common language,” <i>lingua geral</i>. It is
derived mainly from the idiom of the Tupis, whose
villages were found by the first discoverers along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
seaboard, from the mouth of the La Plata to the
Amazon and far up the stream of the latter. According
to their traditions, which are supported by a
comparison of their dialects, the Tupis wandered up
the coast from the south. Their earlier home was
between the Parana river and the Atlantic. There
they called themselves <i>Carai</i>, the astute, a term they
afterwards applied to the Spaniards, but later were
given the name <i>Guaranis</i>, meaning warriors, by which
they are generally known. They must have been
very numerous, as a careful estimate made in 1612
computed those then living in the modern states of
Corrientes and Uruguay at 365,000; a census which
could not have been much exaggerated, as about a
century later the Jesuits claimed to have over three
hundred thousand Christianized and living in their
“reductions;”<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> even to-day ninety per cent. of the
population of Uruguay have Guarani blood in their
veins.</p>

<p>The inroads of the Spaniards from the south and of
the kidnapping Portuguese from the east, reduced
their number greatly, and many bands sought safety
in distant removals; thus the Chiriguanos moved far
to the west and settled on the highlands of Bolivia,
where they have increased their stock from four or
five thousand to triple that number,<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> extending as
far south as the Pilcomayo river. On the upper waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of the Parana were the Tapes, a nation so called from
the name of their principal village. It is another
form of Tupi, and means “town.” They received the
early missionaries willingly, and are complimented
by these as being the most docile and intelligent of
any of the nations of South America.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>The Tupi tribes did not extend north of the immediate
banks of the Amazon, nor south of the Rio de
la Plata. It would appear not improbable that they
started from the central highlands where the Tapajoz
on the north and the Paraguay on the south have
their sources. Their main body followed the latter
to the Atlantic, where the Tupis proper separated
and moved up the coast of Brazil. This latter migration
is believed to have been as late as a few hundred
years before the discovery.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Like the Tapuyas, the Tupis have a tendency to
dolicocephaly, but it is less pronounced. They are
less prognathic, the forehead is fuller and the color of
the skin brighter. The hair is generally straight,
but Pöppig saw many among the Cocamas of pure
blood with wavy and even curly hair.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>I have no hesitation in including in the Tupi family
the Mundurucus, or Paris, on the upper Tapajoz.
Their relationship was fully recognized by Professor
Hartt, who was well acquainted with both dialects.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
They are a superior stamp of men, tall, of athletic
figures, light in color, their naked bodies artistically
tattooed. Their women are skilled in weaving cotton
hammocks, and the men pursue some agriculture,
and manufacture handsome feather ornaments.</p>

<p>To the same family belong the Muras and Turas, in
the swampy valley of the Madeira in its middle course,
“an amphibious race of ichthyophagi,” as they are
called by Martius, savage and hostile, and depraved
by the use of the <i>parica</i>, a narcotic, intoxicating
snuff prepared from the dried seeds of the <i>Mimosa
acacioides</i>. At the beginning of this century they
were estimated at 12,000 bowmen; but this was doubtless
a great exaggeration. Though their dialect differs
widely from the <i>lingua geral</i>, the majority of
their words are from Tupi roots.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Others are related
to the language of the Moxos, and in the last century
certain of their tribes lived in the immediate vicinity
of these, and were brought into the “reductions” of
the Moxos Indians by the Jesuit missionaries.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> The
tendency of their migrations has been down the
Madeira.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The tribes of this lineage in the extreme south of
Brazil were numerous. The Guachaguis, corresponding
apparently to the modern Guachis, are said
by Lozano to speak a corrupt Guarani.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Vocabularies
have been obtained by Castelnau and Natterer,
which indicate only a remote resemblance. According
to their own tradition, they migrated from near
the Moxos in the Bolivian highlands.</p>

<p>The Gualachos, who spread from the river Iguaza
to the sea coast, spoke a Guarani dialect in which the
sounds of <i>f</i>, <i>j</i> and <i>l</i> were present, which, in pure
Guarani, are absent. They built thatched houses
divided into several rooms, and raised abundant harvests.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>The Omaguas and Cocamas, the most western of
the Tupis, dwelling within the limits of Ecuador,
had evidently profited by their contiguity to the civilization
of Peru, as they are described by early travelers
as familiar with gold, silver and copper, living
in permanent villages connected by good roads, and
cultivating large fields of cotton, maize and various
food-plants. The art-forms which they produced and
the prevalence of sun-worship, with rites similar to
those of Peru, indicate the source of their more advanced
culture. By some authors the Omaguas are
stated to have migrated down the Rio Yupura from
Popayan in New Granada, where a tribe speaking
their dialect, the Mesayas are alleged still to reside.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
The peculiar “mitred” skulls of the Omaguas are an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
artificial deformity prized by them as a beauty.</p>

<p>The Tupi is rich in mythological tales which have
been collected by several competent students of their
tongue. (Hartt, Magalhaes, etc.) Their religion is
a simple animistic nature-worship.</p>

<p>The dead were buried in large urns, usually in localities
set aside for the purpose. One such on the
island Maraho, near the mouth of the Amazon, has
yielded a rich harvest to archæologists.</p>

<p>The general culture of the Tupis was superior to
that of any other Brazilian tribes, but much inferior
to that of the Incas. They were to a slight extent
agricultural, raising maize, manioc, tobacco, which
they smoked in pipes, and several vegetables. Some
fowls, monkeys and peccaries were tamed and used as
food. Their houses were of straw, lattice work and
leaves, sometimes plastered with mud. The communal
system prevailed, twenty or thirty families
occupying one residence. A number of such houses
would be erected on some favorable site and surrounded
by a palisade of strong poles. These towns
were, however, not permanent, and nearly half the
year was spent in hunting and fishing expeditions
along the streams. They went entirely naked, but
wove excellent hammocks from the bark of trees and
other vegetable fibres. Devoid of a knowledge of
metals, they were in the height of the age of polished
stone, many of their products in this direction being
celebrated for symmetry and delicacy.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> The art of
the potter was also well developed, and the vases from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the Amazon, called <i>igasauas</i>, rank both in symmetry,
decoration and fine workmanship among the most
creditable specimens of American ceramics.</p>

<p>The language which characterizes this widely distributed
stock is polysynthetic and incorporating,
with the flexibility peculiar to this class of tongues.
It has been the subject of a number of works, but still
lacks a thorough comparative treatment. The Jesuit
missionaries adopted the Guarani dialect throughout
their extensive “reductions,” and translated into it a
variety of works for the instruction of their acolytes,
some of which have been printed.</p>

<h5><i>2. The Tapuyas.</i></h5>

<p>The <i>Tapuya</i> stock is at once the most ancient and
the most extensive now living on the soil of Brazil.
Its various tribes are found from s. lat. 5° to s. lat.
20°, and from the Atlantic to the Schingu river. The
name <i>Tapuya</i> was applied to them by the Tupis, and
means “enemies” or “strangers”&mdash;two ideas which
are always synonymous in primitive life. They are
also called <i>Crens</i> or <i>Guerens</i>, the Old Ones or Ancient
People. This seems to have reference to their possession
of the coast before the arrival of the Tupi
hordes from the south.</p>

<p>By some writers they are believed to have been the
earliest constructors of the <i>sambaquis</i>, the shell-heaps
or kitchen-middens, which are of great size and numerous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
along the Atlantic and its bays. These are
supposed to indicate an antiquity of 2,000 years;<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> but
the Tapuyas can lay claim to a title to their land far
older than that. The skulls and human bones which
were discovered by Dr. Lund in the caves of Lagoa
Santa in immediate juxtaposition to those of animals
now extinct, came from a region occupied by the Tapuyas,
and are in all respects parallel to those of the
tribe to-day. This would assign them a residence on
the spot far back in the present geologic period.</p>

<p>Their appearance is that of an antique race of men.
They are of middle height, with long upper and short
lower extremities. The face is broad, the eyes small
and under prominent ridges, the forehead low and retreating;
the sutures are simple, the face prognathic,
and the skull decidedly dolichocephalic (73), but of
good capacity (1470 cub. cent.), and leptorhinic; the
mouth is large and the nose prominent. In color
they present a variety of shades of reddish-brown,
and their hair, which is coarse, verges rather on the
dark-brown than the black.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> They are not ugly,
and the expression of the face, especially in the
young, is often attractive. Those of them, however,
who distend the lower lip with the large labret or
<i>botoque</i> (from which the <i>Botocudos</i> derive their name),
cannot be other than hideous to European eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>In culture the Tapuyas are reported to stand on the
lowest scale. When free in their native woods they
go absolutely naked; they have no other houses than
temporary shelters of leaves and branches; they manufacture
no pottery, build no canoes, and do not know
how to swim. When first in contact with the whites
they had no dogs, knew nothing of the use of tobacco
or salt, and were common cannibals. They have no
tribal organizations and no definite religious rites.</p>

<p>To counterbalance all these negatives, I hasten to
add that they are hunters of singular skill, using
strong bows with long arrows, manufacture polished
stone axes and weave baskets of reeds, and, what is
rare among the Indians, use tapers made from wild
bees-wax and bark fibre.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Their marriages are monogamous,
though rarely permanent, and they are not
devoid of family affection.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Though lacking definite
religious ideas, they are careful to bury the dead, and
have a belief that the spirit of the departed survives
and wanders about at night, for which reason they
are loth to move in the dark. The soul of a chief
may take the form of a jaguar. During a thunder
storm they shake a burning brand and shoot arrows
toward the sky, to appease by imitation the powers of
the storm; and they are much given to semi-religious
dances, in which their motions are to the sound of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
native flute, which is played with the nose.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Their language is difficult in its phonetics, and
presents a contrast to most American tongues by its
tendency toward the isolating form, with slight agglutination.
A carefully prepared vocabulary of it has
recently been published by Dr. Paul Ehrenreich,<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
whose studies on this stock have been peculiarly
valuable.</p>

<p>The Goyotacas in the province of Goyaz and the

which Von Martius has shown to have sufficient linguistic
affinity among themselves to unite in one
group, and connections enough with the Tapuya
stem to be regarded as one of its sub-stocks.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>All these tribes are found in the vicinity of the

lines tattooed or incised on the cheeks. They take
their name, as do some other Brazilian tribes not related
to them, from the beautiful toucan bird, which
is frequently held sacred among them, and is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
chosen as the totem of a gens.</p>

<p>I also attach to this stock the Carnijos or Fornio, a
vocabulary of whose language has been published by
Professor John C. Branner, and which hitherto has
not been identified.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> The following comparison between

<h5><i>3. The Arawaks.</i></h5>

<p>The Arawak stock of languages is the most widely
disseminated of any in South America. It begins at
the south with the Guanas, on the head-waters of the
river Paraguay, and with the Baures and Moxos on
the highlands of southern Bolivia, and thence extends
almost in continuity to the Goajiros peninsula, the
most northern land of the continent. Nor did it cease
there. All the Antilles, both Greater and Less, were
originally occupied by its members, and so were the
Bahama Islands,<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> thus extending its dialects to within
a short distance of the mainland of the northern continent,
and over forty-five degrees of latitude. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
tribes probably at one time occupied the most of the
lowlands of Venezuela, whence they were driven not
long before the discovery by the Caribs, as they also
were from many of the southern islands of the West
Indian archipelago. The latter event was then of
such recent occurrence that the women of the Island
Caribs, most of whom had been captured from the
Arawaks, still spoke that tongue.</p>

<p>They were thus the first of the natives of the New
World to receive the visitors from European climes,
and the words picked up by Columbus and his successors
on the Bahamas, Cuba and Hayti, are readily
explained by the modern dialects of this stock. No
other nation was found on any part of the archipelago
except the two I have mentioned. The whole of the
coast between the mouths of the Orinoco and Amazon
appears to have been in their possession at or a short
time before the epoch of the discovery.</p>

<p>The Antis or Campas, who perhaps occupy the
original home of the stock, own as the centre of their
domain the table-land known as El Gran Pajonal, or
the Great Grass Field, bounded by the rivers Ucayali,
Pachitea and Perene. Their hue is a bistre and their
habits wild; some slight tillage is carried on, and the
women spin and weave the wild cotton into coarse
garments. The taming of animals is one of their arts,
and around their huts are seen monkeys, parrots, peccaries
and tapirs.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> It is noteworthy that some of
them are skilful blacksmiths, smelting the metal
from the native ores, and working it into axes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
knives, spear points, etc., of excellent quality.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>The names Campas and Antis were used as generic
terms, the latter applied to the tribes on the slopes of
the Cordilleras and the former to those on the plains.
A large number of sub-tribes are named by the older
writers, the principal of which were the Choseosos,
Machigangas, Pilcosumis and Sepaunabos. The Machigangas
lived on the Pilcopata and Vilcanota, and
their language has been erroneously stated by Von
Tschudi to be an independent stock.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> The Chunchas
and Cholones are by some classed with the Campas,
and they are said to have been the possessors of the
famous Cerro de Sal, or Salt Mountain, to which the
neighboring tribes repaired in great numbers to obtain
supplies of this useful article.</p>

<p>The Guanas are a nation who have long lived on
the upper Paraguay, in the province Mato Grosso
on the river Mambaya, and vicinity. D’Orbigny believed
that they were a member of the Mataco group,<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
but they are now recognized as belonging to the
Arawak stock. They are noteworthy for their peaceful
disposition and unusual intelligence. Hervas
speaks of them as the most able nation visited by the
missionaries in the whole of America.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> The traveler
Castelnau confirmed this good opinion. He found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
them living in neat houses and cultivating the land
with skill and industry. They raised not only the
ordinary food plants, but cotton and sugar cane,
pressing the sap from the latter by machinery of their
own devising, and moulding the sugar into loaves.
Their cotton cloth, dyed of various colors, was highly
esteemed for its texture.</p>

<p>Castelnau describes them as occupying four settlements
near Albuquerque and Miranda, and comprising
the Chualas or Guanas proper, the Terenos, the
Laianas, and the Quiniquinaos.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Later investigations
have shown that of these the Terenos and Quiniquinaos
are members of the Guaycuru stock of the Chaco,
and that the Chualas and Laianas alone belong to the
true Guanas.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Paiconecas</i> or Paunacas were attached to the
mission of the Conception in Bolivia, in 16° south latitude.
They numbered about 500 in 1831. In customs
and appearance they approached the Chiquitos.
Their former home was between the sources of the
Rio Blanco and Rio Verde.</p>

<p>The <i>Saravecas</i>, three or four hundred in number in
1831, were attached to the mission of Santa Anna, in
Bolivia, and were its handsomest members. Their
former homes were in the eastern hills of the Cordillera,
about 16° south latitude.</p>

<p>Although these are classed as irreducible stocks
by D’Orbigny and others who have followed him,
they are both clearly branches of the Arawak stem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
as will be seen by a brief comparison.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>Others could readily be added, but the above are
sufficient.</p>

<p>Another important tribe of this stock in this region
were the Piros, otherwise called Chuntaquiros and
Simirenchis, whose home was about the junction of
the Ucayali and Apurimac, and thence along both
these rivers. The vocabularies of their tongue obtained
by Castelnau and Paul Marcoy leave no doubt
of their affiliations. They were largely converted by
the Jesuits between 1683 and 1727.</p>

<p>The Wapisianas, or Wapianas in British Guiana,
with their sub-tribe the Atorai (Tauri or Dauri), are
stated by Im Thurn to speak a tongue wholly different
from the Arawak; but an analysis of its expression
and an extended comparison place it beyond doubt in
this stock.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>The Tarumas and Maopityans, who now live in
southern British Guiana, but are said to have originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
come from the Rio Negro, speak related dialects.</p>

<p>They enjoy a rather high degree of culture, being
celebrated for the manufacture of cassava graters, for
the hunting dogs which they breed and train, and for
the fine pottery they manufacture. Both Schomburgk
and Im Thurn regard them as an independent stock;
but from a comparison of the fifteen nouns given by
the former in their language,<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> I infer that they are
an Arawak tribe, speaking a dialect mixed with some
Carib and Tupi words, and with frequent vowel
elision.</p>

<p>This comparison leaves little doubt but that this
mixed dialect is chiefly of Arawak lineage.</p>

<p>The Arawaks wandered as far east as the upper
Schingu river, where Von den Steinen found the
Kustenau, a distant member of the stem, with various
minor tribes, as the Vauras, Mehinacus, etc. Along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the river Ventuari the populous tribe of the Maipures
have taken a conspicuous place in the annals of the
missions. Indeed, the whole stock is sometimes called
by their name;<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> but it is well to retain the better known
<i>Arawak</i>, which is the appellation of that portion of
the tribe in Guiana between the Corentin and Pomeroon
rivers. It means “meal-eaters,” and was first applied
to them in derision on account of their large
consumption of cassava bread.</p>

<p>There is a prevailing similarity in their physical
type. The adults are slightly undersized, rarely
reaching above five feet six inches, with low foreheads
and straight narrow noses. The form of the skull is
short and the jaws are not protruding&mdash;orthognathic
and brachycephalic.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> The physical force averages
less than that of the European, and there is decidedly
less power of resisting disease.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> The Jesuit Eder mentions
a peculiarity among the Peruvian Arawaks,
(Moxos, Baures). It is that the end of the little finger
does not reach to the last joint of the third finger.
The absence of this peculiarity he states will reveal a
mixture of Spanish blood to the third generation.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
It would be interesting to learn how widely this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
noticeable.</p>

<p>The culture of the Arawak stock was generally
somewhat above the stage of savagery. On the West
Indian islands Columbus found them cultivating
maize, potatoes, manioc, yams and cotton. They
were the first to introduce to Europeans the wondrous
art of tobacco smoking. They wove cotton into garments,
and were skilful in polishing stone. They
hammered the native gold into ornaments, carved
curious masks of wood, blocked rude idols out of
large stones, and hollowed the trunks of trees to
construct what they called <i>canoes</i>.</p>

<p>Such is approximately the culture of the existing
tribes of the stock. The Arawaks of Guiana also raise
cassava and maize, though they depend largely on
hunting and fishing. Like the northern tribes, they
have well-developed gentile or totemic systems, with
descent in the female line.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Marriages are by purchase,
and the strange custom of the <i>couvade</i> obtains;
that is, at the period of parturition the husband takes
to his hammock, and is waited on as if he was the sick
one. Their houses are usually single, not communal,
and are furnished with swinging hammocks, mats,
basket-work and pottery.</p>

<p>The Haytian mythology was quite extensive, and
the legends of the Arawaks of Guiana have been collected,
and are also rich. In all the tribes the dead
were generally buried, and often the house of the deceased
was destroyed or the spot deserted.</p>

those of the Banivas and Maipures. About the middle
of this century the traveller Richard Spruce found
them in the regions assigned by Gilii to other tribes,
indicating a displacement of the population. He collected
a number of vocabularies, offering sufficient
evidence in his opinion to establish the relationship
of the following bands:<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<h5><i>4. The Caribs.</i></h5>

<p>The Carib stock is one of the most extensively distributed
in the southern continent. At the discovery
its dialects were found on the Lesser Antilles, the
Caribby Islands, and on the mainland from the mouth
of the Essequibo River to the Gulf of Maracaibo.
West of the latter it did not reach the coast, nor has
any positive traces of its introduction above the straits
of Panama earlier than the conquest been found, in
spite of frequent assertions to the contrary. Inland
from the Arawaks on the shore of Guiana are a number
of Carib tribes, as the Macusi and Woyawoi, so
numerous that this region has been thought by some
to have been the original home of the stock; but the
discovery by Dr. Karl von den Steinen of a tribe, the
Bakairi, on the head-waters of the Schingu River,
speaking a very pure form of the language,<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> and the
recognition of the Carib affinities of the Palmellas on
the Rio dos Baures, throw another light on the trend
of Carib migrations, strongly supported by a series of
other considerations. Thus, it has been satisfactorily
shown by Im Thurn that the Caribs in Guiana wandered
thither from the Orinoco district, some inland
and some along the coast, and probably from the
large islands adjacent to the coasts.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>These islands in turn were peopled from the mainland
to the east, as I have already shown, their earlier
population having been Arawak. All the Island,
Orinoco and Guiana Caribs can thus be traced back
to the mainland of northern Venezuela. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
vicinity was spoken the Cumanagoto dialect, in the
province of Cumana or New Andalusia. According
to the early missionaries, it was current along the
coast for more than a hundred leagues, extending into
the province of Caracas and beyond. The tribes who
spoke it were the Chaymas, the Cores, the Cumanas,
the Quacas, the Parias, the Palenques, the Varrigones,
and others.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Other dialects to the west are the
Opone and Carare, specimens of which were obtained
by Lengerke in the vicinity of Bucaramanga, province
of Santander.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>The sierra which divides the head-waters of the
Caura from those of the Rio Branco and other streams
flowing into the Rio Negro and Amazon, are peopled
on both slopes by wandering tribes of the Carib stock.
Near the sources of the Caura, Chaffanjon found the
once formidable Guaharibos, now naked and wretched
fugitives, fearing the white far more than they are
feared by him.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> On the southern slope, along the
Rio Jauapery and neighboring streams, are bands
of Crichanas, Ipurucotos (Purigotos), Macuchis, and
Jauamerys (Waimiris), all speaking nearly related
dialects of the Carib tongue. Dr. Barboza Rodrigues
has given a touching picture of their recent struggles
with the whites of the adjacent settlements, and the
miserable condition to which they are reduced. We
owe to the same sympathetic naturalist an interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
description of their customs and language.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>The hill tribes of French Guiana are known as
Roucouyennes, from the <i>roucou</i>, a vegetable coloring
matter with which they paint their skins. They
exhale a peculiar odor like that of new leather, probably
from the action of the tannin in the roucou on
the skin. Naturally they are light in color, and at
birth almost white.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Marriages of father and daughter,
or brother and sister, are not rare among them.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>A connecting link between these Caribs of Guiana
and the Bakairis of the south is supplied by the
Apiacas of the Rio Tocantins, who speak a pure
dialect of the stock, midway in character between
those of the two extremes named.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>The Arubas, who occupied the island of that name
off the coast of Venezuela, and whose mixed descendants
now speak the Papamiento jargon, are no doubt
correctly assigned to this stock by M. Pinart. They
were skillful potters, and buried their dead in large
urns. The numerous polychromatic petroglyphs they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
have left and their peculiar character are especially
noteworthy.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>Sir Robert H. Schomburgk classifies the Carib
stock in Guiana as follows, giving a short specimen
of each dialect, which differ, he says, among themselves
about as much as French and Italian.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>The Guaques, who live on the head-waters of the
Caqueta or Yapura river, have not been heretofore
identified as Caribs; but their dialect, as collected by
Presbyter Manuel P. Albis in 1853, leaves no doubt as
to its relationship. He describes them as intelligent
and kindly, but incorrigible and dexterous thieves,
skillful in the collection of wax and the preparation
of poisons. Nowhere is the couvade with its associate
superstitions more rigidly observed. No woman must
be seen by men during her catamenia, and at childbirth
she must separate from the household for three
months. During all that time her husband strictly
observes a diet and seclusion.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>The lower Orinoco basin was for a long time the
center of distribution of the stock; they probably had
driven from it nations of Arawak lineage, some of
whom, as the Goajiros, they pushed to the west,
where they were in contact with the Carib Motilones,<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
and others to the islands and the shores to the east.
The Carijonas and Guaques on the head-waters of the
Yapura or Caqueta are now their most western hordes,
and the Pimenteiras on the Rio Paruahyba are their
most eastern. We can thus trace their scattered
bands over thirty-five degrees of latitude and thirty of
longitude. The earliest center of distribution which
best satisfies all the conditions of the problem would
be located in the Bolivian highlands, not remote from
that I have assigned to the Arawaks.</p>

<p>The physical features of the Caribs assimilate
closely to those of the Arawaks. They are taller in
the average and more vigorous, but their skulls are
equally brachycephalic and orthognathic. They are
beardless, and have the same variability in color of
skin. As good specimens of the modern Caribs we
may take the tribes of Venezuela. These are spoken
of as “the strongest, handsomest and most intelligent
of any of the natives in northern South America.”<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
They are tall, straight and symmetrical, the women
not less muscular than the men. The hair is sometimes
slightly wavy, as Von den Steinen saw among
the Bakairi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>The Caribs have had a bad reputation as to culture
on account of their anthropophagous tendencies.
Indeed, the word <i>cannibal</i> is a mispronunciation of
their proper name, <i>Karina</i>. But they were quite on
a par with their neighbors, the Arawaks, and in some
respects superior to them. For instance, their canoes
were larger and finer, and they had invented the device
of the sail, which seems to have been unknown
to all the other tribes on the continent. To some extent
they were agricultural, and their pottery was of
superior quality.</p>

<p>The beginnings of picture-writing were in use
among them, and the remarkable rock inscriptions
still visible on the Orinoco and the Essequibo are attributable
to them, and were probably intended as
conjurations to the supernatural powers, similar to
others which remain in St. Vincent and other islands
from the date of the Carib occupation.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Their family
life was not usually communal, but each household
occupied its own dwelling. In some parts, as in the
deltas of the Essequibo and Orinoco, and even on the
dry savannas, their huts were built on a substructure
of piles which lifted them five or six feet from the
ground or the water, as the case might be.</p>

<p>The religious rites they observed were often elaborate.
Their principal divinities are said to have been
the sun, moon and earth, the latter of which was
spoken of as the mother of the race. They practiced
the <i>couvade</i>, and their priests, called <i>piaye</i>, exercised
unlimited power, and were correspondingly feared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the opinion of Von Martius that the Carib,
the Tupi-Guarani and the Arawak stocks are traceable
to some very ancient common tongue. This
view is at first sight strengthened by a wide comparison
of vocabularies, but is weakened by an examination
of the grammars of the three families, especially
their pronominal elements. It is probable that the
three ancestral tribes had early and close communication,
but not original identity.</p>

<p>The seeming relationship has been rendered more
prominent in certain instances by free later borrowings.
M. Adam has shown that some of the northern
dialects are in the condition of jargons, their grammar
on the Carib model, their words drawn from
various stocks. Such are the “Island Carib,” which
is largely Arawak, and the Boni-Ouyana, described by
Dr. Crévaux.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<h5><i>5. The Cariris.</i></h5>

<p>In his enumeration of the tribes of Central Brazil,
Von Martius brings together a large number who
once dwelt in the provinces of Bahia and Pernambuco,
under the general title, “the Guck or Coco
stem,” so called from the word which in many of
them means “the paternal uncle.”<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> This division
has not been endorsed by later research, and it is
evident that Von Martius included several quite different
stocks under this appellation.</p>

<p>Among these, the most prominent were the <i>Cariris</i>
or Kiriri. They are now reduced to about 600 souls,
but at one time were a powerful nation, and in 1699<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the Jesuit Mamiani published a grammar and other
works in their tongue.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> They were among the more
cultivated of the Brazilian tribes, given to agriculture,
skilled in dyeing and weaving cotton, employing
a primitive spindle and loom, with weapons of
several kinds and of superior finish.</p>

<p>The Sabuyas, who dwell near them, speak a closely
related dialect; but further affinities have not been
verified. They have, indeed, many loan words from
the Tupi, and some from the Carib stock, but the
ground-work of these tongues is different. Von den
Steinen offers some reasons for believing that they
moved down the Amazon from a far western residence.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<h5><i>6. The Coroados, Carajas and others.</i></h5>

<p>The Coroados derive their name from the Portuguese
word <i>coroa</i>, a crown, the term “crowned”
being applied to several native tribes who wore their
hair in a peculiar manner. It is not at all an ethnic
designation, and I use it to bring into relief the
need of some term of greater precision. Thus, there
are the Coroados who are neighbors and linguistically
related to the Puris, dwelling on the Paruahyba river.
By some they have been included among the Tapuyas
as alleged relatives of the Botocudos. But not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
is there no relationship of language, but physically
they are widely apart. The Puris-Coroados are a
dark yellow brown, with mesocephalic heads, dark
brown oblique eyes, large mouths and thick lips&mdash;nowise
the type of the Botocudo. They are moreover
agricultural in habits, and farther advanced in the
arts.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>There are other Coroados in the extreme south of
Brazil, in the province of Rio Grande do Sul, whither
they are said to have wandered from the north.
These do not appear to be Botocudos either. They
have round heads, dark brown eyes, low foreheads,
and are of a light coffee color. They are noticeable
for their clean and ornamental huts, and for their
skill in hunting, in which they employ arrows five
feet in length, with bone points. They pray to certain
stars as protective divinities, and like some
northern tribes, clean and preserve the bones of the
dead.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Carajas</i> belong to a stock who dwell on the
affluents of the river Araguay, in the province of
Goyaz in southern Brazil. The traveler Castelnau<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
penetrated to them, and was our earliest source of information
about them. They are wild and warlike,
with a bad reputation among their neighbors. He
was told they had no religion and no rites, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
that they were strictly monogamous and singularly
firm moralists, punishing libertinage with the death
of both parties; statements which do not accord.
Their method of burial was curious. The corpse
was interred in an upright position, the head out of
the ground. An ample stock of bananas and other
food was placed near it, and renewed from time to
time. This clearly indicates a belief in life after
death. The pure Carajas are markedly dolichocephalic.</p>

<p>The Caraja language is known too imperfectly to
permit a proper study of its relationship. It is complex
and difficult, and spoken differently by the men
and the women. From the scant material at hand I
perceive lexical relationship in some important words
to the Tapuya stock,<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> but a wide divergence in
phonetics and apparently in construction. Its members
are as follows:</p>

<p>A certain number of vocabularies have been obtained
by travelers in Brazil from mixed-blood
tribes, who spoke dialects sometimes compounded
of several native tongues, sometimes of these mingled
with Portuguese or negro elements. Such is the
dialect of the <i>Meniens</i>, who lived in eastern Brazil
near the Villa Belmonte, whose speech was a jargon
of the Tapuya and negro languages; and that of the
<i>Cames</i> in the interior of San Paulo, who also made
use of a barbarous dialect, compounded of the African
idioms of runaway slaves, and that of the Botocudos.
The Catoquina, a specimen of which was obtained
by Spix from a band on the affluent of the Jurua,
and the Catoxa or Cotoxo of the Rio Parda, are other
examples.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<h5><i>7. The Orinoco Basin; Carib Sub-Stock; Salivas; Arawak
Sub-Stock; Otomacos; Guamas; Guayoas;

<p>The Llanos of Venezuela coincide with the former
“Territory of Caqueta,” and embrace a region about
forty thousand square miles in extent, covered either
with grass and rushes or with dense forests. In the
wet season it is a vast marsh, in the dry it is scorched by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
a burning sun, raising the thermometer daily to over
100° in the shade. Yet the Llanos are but a part of
the vast upper water-shed of the northern affluents of
the Amazon and those of the Orinoco, which together
drain a country larger than the whole of France.</p>

<p>This wide expanse is thinly populated with bands
of savages, gaining their subsistence chiefly from the
rivers, few of them brought within the range of civilized
influences. Linguistically the majority belong
to the Arawak and the Carib stocks; but there are
numbers of tribes whose affinities are uncertain, or
who are apparently of quite another lineage. Scores
of names are found in the records of the missions and
on the pages of travelers, of peoples who have disappeared
or are now known by other designations. Alexander
von Humboldt named and located 186 tribes
on the Orinoco and its affluents alone; but renounced
as hopeless the attempt to give them a linguistic
classification.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> I shall not attempt to unravel the
tangled ethnography of this region farther than to
mention those tribes concerning whom specimens of
language or the statements of European visitors permit
a reasonable guess as to their affinities.</p>

<p>Something over a century ago, when Father Gilii
wrote, largely from personal knowledge, his description
of the tribes on the Orinoco and its affluents, he
believed they could be included in nine linguistic
stocks,<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The <i>Carib</i> in a number of dialects, as the Tamanaca,
the Paiura, the Quiri-Quiripa, the Mapuya,
the Guanero, the Guayquira, the Palenque, the Maquiritare,
the Oje, the Mucuru, and others.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Saliva</i>, to which he assigned the dialects
Ature, Piaroa and Quaqua.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Maipure</i> (Arawak), in its dialects Avane,
Meepure, Cavere, Parene, Guipunave, and Chirupa.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Otomaca</i>, with one dialect, the Tarapita.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Guama</i>, with its dialect, the Quaquaro.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Guayba</i>, related to the Chiricoa.</p>

<p>7. The <i>Jaruri</i> (<i>Yarura</i>).</p>

<p>8. The <i>Guaraunos</i>.</p>

<p>9. The <i>Aruaca</i>.</p>

<p>This classification can stand as only approximately
accurate, but it serves as an excellent starting point.</p>

<p>Beginning with the Carib stock, and basing my list
on the works of Codazzi and more recent travelers,
especially Crévaux, Coudreau and Chaffanjon, I offer
the following as the tribes which may be definitely
located as its members:</p>

<h6>CARIB SUB-STOCK IN THE ORINOCO REGION.</h6>

<div class="list-container">
<ul>
<li><i>Amarizonas</i> (<i>Amarisanes</i>), near the Rio Guaviare and Rios Etari and Ayrico.</li>
<li><i>Arecunas</i>, on head-waters of the Rio Caroni.</li>
<li><i>Ariguas</i>, near the Rio Tauca.</li>
<li><i>Cabiunes</i>, on the Rio Apoporis.</li>
<li><i>Carataimas</i>, on the Rio Cauca.</li>
<li><i>Chaymas</i>, on the Rio Guarapiche.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span><i>Cucciveros</i>, on the Rio Cauca.</li>
<li><i>Cuneguaras</i>, on the Rio Maturin.</li>
<li><i>Enaguas</i>, on the Rio Agua Branca.</li>
<li><i>Guarives</i>, on the Rio Uñare.</li>
<li><i>Maquiritares</i>, on the Orinoco, near Lake Carida and Rio Ventuari.</li>
<li><i>Matanos</i>, on Rio Caura.</li>
<li><i>Mucos</i>, on Rio Apoporis.</li>
<li><i>Panares</i>, on Rio Caura.</li>
<li><i>Parecas</i>, on the lower Orinoco.</li>
<li><i>Paudacotos</i>, near the Rio Caura.</li>
<li><i>Quiri-Quiripas</i>, on the lower Orinoco.</li>
<li><i>Quivas</i>, on the Orinoco near the confluence of the Meta.</li>
<li><i>Tamanacas</i>, on lower Orinoco.</li>
<li><i>Tuapocos</i>, on the Rio Maturin.</li>
<li><i>Vayamanos</i>, on the Rio Paragua.</li>
<li><i>Yaos</i>, on the Rio de la Trinidad.</li>
<li><i>Yocunos</i>, on the Rio Apoporis.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Even when Codazzi collected his material, more
than half a century ago, the once powerful Tamanacas
had entirely disappeared, and no tribe of the name
existed in the region.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> The process of dissolution
and destruction has gone on since his day with increasing
rapidity, so that when Chaffanjon visited the
Orinoco and Caura in 1884, he found that immense
and fertile region almost uninhabited, the ancient
tribes scattered and disappeared, or existing only in
wretched remnants, <i>misérables débris</i>, of their former
selves.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> The opportunity is forever lost, therefore,
to define the ethnography of this region by original
observation, and we are thrown back on the collections
and statements of former observers.</p>

<p>The Maquiritares, however, still remain as one of
the handsomest peoples on the Orinoco, and remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
for the skill with which they manufacture canoes
sixty or seventy feet long from the trunk of a single
tree.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>On the river Uaupes, an affluent of the Rio Negro
M. Coudreau encountered various tribes, such as the
Tarianos or Javis and the Nnehengatus, of whose
tongues he obtained brief vocabularies. They indicate
a distant influence of the Carib stock, especially
the latter, but they seem mixed largely with elements
from other sources.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> They dwell adjacent to the
Tucanos, to whom I have already referred as assigned
by some to the Tapuyas. (See above, p. <a href="#Page_240">240</a>.)</p>

<p>Gilii’s second group, the <i>Salivas</i>, offers difficulties.
There appears to be none of them under that name at
present on the Orinoco. Chaffanjon states that the
Atures have become extinct.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> The Piaroas survive,
but the tribe so-called to-day speak a tongue wholly
unlike the Saliva, and unconnected, apparently, with
any other stock;<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> and the modern Quaquas (Guagues)
speak a dialect of the Arawak. Yet a hundred and
fifty years ago the missionaries estimated the Salivas
at four thousand souls. They lived principally on
the river Cinareuco, below the Meta, and also on the
Rio Etari, where they were in contact with the Carib
Amarisanes. They are described as of a kindly and
gentle disposition, well-made in body and willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
scholars of their spiritual masters. In their heathendom
they had the unique custom of disinterring the
bones of their dead after the expiration of a year,
burning them, and then collecting the ashes to mix
with their drinking water.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Their language, which
was vocalic and nasal, has been preserved in sufficient
specimens to serve for comparison. According to
Vergara y Vergara, it is still spoken on the banks of
the Meta,<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> and Hartmann includes in those who employ
it, the Quevacus and Maritzis, at the head of the
Ventuari, and the Mayongcong on the Merevari.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>The Arawak stock, which Gilii calls the <i>Maipure</i>,
had numerous branches in this region. They occupied
much of the Orinoco in its middle and upper
course, as well as the valleys of its affluents. Gumilla
speaks of one of its members, the Caveres, as savage
and inhuman warriors, but as the only nation which
had been able to repulse the attacks of the down-river
Caribs, who were accustomed to ascend the stream in
fleets of eighty to a hundred canoes, destroying every
village on its banks.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The same authority mentions the Achaguas as possessing
the most agreeable and cultured dialect,
though he is in doubt whether it is strictly related to
the Maipure. This nation, quite prominent in the
older annals, still existed in the middle of this century
to the number of five hundred on the Rio Muco.
They were not civilized, and practiced the customs
of polyandry and the destruction of female infants.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
Cassani refers to them as on the river Ele, and describes
them as tattooed and painted, with well-formed
bodies and taking great pride in preserving and dressing
their magnificent hair.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>From a variety of sources at my disposition I have
prepared the following list of the</p>

<h6>ARAWAK SUB-STOCK IN THE ORINOCO REGION.</h6>

<div class="list-container">

</ul>
</div>

<p>The <i>Otomacos</i> remain, as Gilii placed them, an independent
stock, with their single dialect, the Tarapita.
The Jesuits first encountered them in 1732,
amid the forests south of the Orinoco, between the
Paos and the Jaruros. In later years they are described
as a low grade of savages, given to the eating
of earth. They are also said to be monogamous, and
the women among them enjoy an unusual degree of
consideration, being permitted to take equal part in
the public games.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Their present locality appears to
be on or near the river Meta.</p>

<p>The tribes whom Gilii mentions as the <i>Guamas</i>
and Quaquaros lived on the banks of the Rio Apure,
and in his day had the reputation of “a numerous
and valorous people.”<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> They were not unacquainted
with some of the arts, and were particularly skillful
in the manufacture of small figures in terra cotta,
many of which are to be picked up on the sites of
their ancient villages. Now, however, they have
been smitten with the fate of their race, and are reduced
to a few miserable vagrants, destined to disappear
wholly in a few years. Their arts are lost, and
the oppression of the whites has driven from them all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
hopes of bettering their condition.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>Of their language I have no specimens. According
to Felipe Perez, it is related to the Omagua, and hence
should be included in the Tupi stock; but this writer
is not always dependable.</p>

<p>The <i>Guaybas</i> (Guahibos) and Chiricoas dwelt originally
on the broad plains between the Casanare and
Meta rivers; but a number of them were converted in
the latter half of the seventeenth century and persuaded
to come to the missions. They soon returned
to their roving life. Cassani speaks of them as of
mild and friendly disposition, but incorrigible vagabonds,
“the gypsies of the Indies,” constantly migrating
from place to place.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> They have never lost
their love of the wilderness, and it has been their salvation,
for they still survive&mdash;quite a numerous people&mdash;on
the left bank of the Orinoco, from the Rio Meta
to the Vichada. They are rebellious to all attempts at
civilization, and the white man is not safe who ventures
into their territory.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>Humboldt, in his discussion of the tribes of the
Orinoco, refers to the Guahibos as white in color,
and founds some speculations on this fact. Their
hue is indeed light, at times what may fairly be
called a dirty white; but in this respect we are assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
by recent and competent authority they do not differ
from their neighbors, the Maquiritares and Piaroas. It
is not a question of descent, but of climatic surroundings
and mode of life.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>The home of the <i>Jaruris</i>, Yaruras, or, as they called
themselves, Japurin, was on and near the Orinoco,
between the rivers Meta and Capanapaco. They
depended on hunting and fishing, and were indolent
and averse to agriculture. They had few arts, but
were friendly in disposition, not given to drunkenness,
and usually monogamous. At present they
number scarcely a hundred individuals, badly formed,
afflicted with contagious disease, and rapidly on the
road to extinction. They have lost their trait of
sobriety, and a man will readily offer his wife or
daughter in exchange for a bottle of brandy. (Chaffanjon.)</p>

<p>The <i>Guaraunos</i>, called by the English <i>Warraus</i>,
continue to live in considerable numbers&mdash;some say
about fifteen thousand&mdash;in and near the delta of the
Orinoco. They are a thrifty, healthy people, building
their houses ingeniously upon piles to protect
them from the periodical overflows of the stream.
This method of construction, however, was adopted
only when they sought as refuge marshy and lonely
spots to escape their enemies. Contrary to the statements
of most travelers, those who know them best
report them as preferring dry uplands, where they
make clearings, plantations and houses with singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
industry and skill. The favorite wood used in such
construction is the <i>temiche</i> (not the <i>moriche</i>) palm,
which they call, from its magnificent fronds, “the
feathers of the sun,” <i>ya juji</i>.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>Humboldt placed their number at the beginning of
the century at about six thousand, which is doubtless
more correct than the later estimates. He adds that
the Guayquiries, who inhabited the peninsula of
Araya and the adjacent islands of Margarita, “admit
the relationship of their language with that of the
Guaraunos.”<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> At the beginning of the last century
Gumilla found them living on the south bank of the
Orinoco in a most wretched condition and nearly annihilated
by their merciless enemies, the Caribs. It is
probable, therefore, that they removed from that location
to the coast.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> No other dialect of the tongue, so
far as I know, has been discovered, and it seems an independent
stock.</p>

<p>In appearance they are dark in hue, of muscular
build, hair black, abundant and very fine, noses
straight and well-shaped, skull brachycephalic, stature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
below medium.</p>

<p>The <i>Aruaca</i> mentioned by Gilii were some tribes
of the Arawaks who occasionally visited the southern
bank of the Orinoco, and whose relations to the Maypures
were not known to him. They are also mentioned
by other authors.</p>

<p>Having thus reviewed the linguistic stocks named by
Gilii, I shall proceed to mention some which escaped
his attention.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of these is the <i>Betoi</i>, or
<i>Betoya</i>. This tongue derived its name from a tribe
dwelling at the foot of the mountains of Bogota, between
the rivers Apure and Tame, and are therefore
included by some among the Indians of New Granada.
From a number of authorities I find the following
members are attributed to the</p>

<h6>BETOYA LINGUISTIC STOCK.</h6>

<div class="list-container">
<ul>
<li><i>Airicos</i>, on head-waters of the Manacacia, the Ele and Guainia.</li>
<li><i>Amaguages</i>, near Rio Caqueta.</li>
<li><i>Anibalis</i>, on Rio Apure.</li>
<li><i>Betois</i>, on and near Rio Casanare, about north latitude 5°.</li>
<li><i>Correguages</i>, on Rio Yari and head-waters of Caqueta.</li>
<li><i>Jamas</i>, on Rio Manacacia.</li>
<li><i>Macaguages</i>, on Rios Caucaya, Mecaya and Sensella.</li>
<li><i>Piojes</i>, on Rio Putumayo, and on the Napo and Caucaya (Cocayu).</li>
<li><i>Quilifayes</i>, on Rio Apure.</li>
<li><i>Situfas</i>, on Rio Casanare.</li>
<li><i>Tamas</i>, on the Rio Yari and Rio Caguo.</li>
<li><i>Tunebos</i>, in the Cordillera, adjacent to the Betois.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Of these, the Piojes and Correguages, of which we
have vocabularies, do not show close resemblance to
the Betoya, yet undoubtedly some;<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> so I place them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
in this stock partly in deference to old authorities.</p>

<p>The Piojes derive their name from the particle of
negation in their language, this being their usual reply
to all inquiries by traders or travelers. They are
divided into two bands, speaking the same dialect,
one on the Napo and one on the Putumayo, neither
knowing anything of the other. Some of their customs
are peculiar. For instance, it is their rule that
a widow shall take her son, a widower his daughter,
to replace the deceased consort.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> They are somewhat
agricultural, and are skillful boatmen.</p>

<p>The Tamas formerly lived on the river Aguarico
(Coleti). Dr. Crévaux found them on the Caguo, a
branch of the Yapura, and obtained from them a
short vocabulary, but enough to mark them as members
of the stock.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> There are also some on the Rio
Meta who speak Spanish only. (Perez.)</p>

<p>The Betoya has impressed me as showing some distant
affinity to the Choco stock, and it may be that
ampler resources on both sides would lead to the establishment
of an original identity. The following
words from the very scanty number which I have for
comparison are noteworthy:</p>

<p>The Macaguages are industrious and agricultural.
Both sexes dress alike in cotton tunics dyed in violet
color, and suspend bright feathers and strings of
beads in ears, nose and lips.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>A singular question has arisen as to the relationship
of the Betoya and the Yarura languages. Their near
connection was affirmed by the early missionaries.
In fact, the history of the conversion of the Betoyas
turns upon the identity of the two tongues. It was
brought about in 1701 by a Yarura Indian, a convert
to Christianity, who accidentally discovered that he
was understood by the Betoyas.</p>

<p>In spite of this detail, it is evident from an inspection
of the vocabularies, that there is absolutely no
relationship between the two idioms. I can only explain
the contradiction as arising from some ambiguity
or similarity of names. The two tribes lived together
in the time of Gumilla, making up about three
thousand souls.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>About the middle of this century some six hundred
of the Betoyas dwelt on the head-waters of the river
Manacacia.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>In the territory of St. Martin, above the falls of the
Guaviare and along the Rio Guejar and the Meta, are
several tribes asserted to speak related dialects, but of
which I have little information. The principal one
is that of the <i>Churoyas</i>, of whom Professor Nicolas
Saenz has given an interesting sketch and a short
vocabulary.<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> They are very ugly, with broad faces,
low foreheads, small and oblique eyes, and in color
like dried tobacco. Nudity is their usual garb, and
the skin is decorated with tattoo marks instead of
clothing. According to Perez they number about
1200.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Following him and other authorities, I may
enumerate the following members of the</p>

<li><i>Choroyas</i>, on the Rio Guejar.</li>

<li><i>Guayues</i>, on the Rio Caqueta.</li>
<li><i>Macos</i>, on the Rio Aguarico.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Whether the Cofanes here named are those of the
Province of Quitu who murdered the Jesuit missionary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Raphael Ferrer, in 1602, I have not discovered. Perez
describes them as still warlike and seclusive, living in
the terminal hills of the Cordillera, and avoiding traffic
with the tribes of the lower river.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>An examination of the vocabulary furnished by
Saenz inclines me to think that the Churoya may be
a mongrel dialect, or at least has borrowed freely
from neighboring stocks. I subjoin the principal
words from his short vocabulary, with some comparisons:</p>

<p>The <i>Piaroas</i> are mentioned by Gilii as a branch of
the Salivas, but their language reveals no such connection.
They are still found on both banks of the
Orinoco above the confluence of the Vichada and
near the mouth of the Mataveni. They are savage
and superstitious, avoiding contact with the whites;
they have had good reason to be extremely distrustful
of the advances of their civilized neighbors. They
are much given to nocturnal ceremonies, and entertain
a great respect for the tapir, who is their reputed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
ancestor, and also the form which is taken by the souls
of the departed.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Puinavis</i> dwell on the Inirida, an affluent of the
Guaviare. A tribe, the Guipunabis, is mentioned by
Gilii as belonging to the Maipure (Arawak) stock; but
it cannot be the same with the one under consideration,
the language of which appears to be without
affinities. Latham identified them with the <i>Poignavis</i>
of the older writers, and on slight linguistic evidence,
believed them connected with the Banivas.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> My own
comparisons do not justify this opinion.</p>

<h5><i>8. The Upper Amazonian Basin.</i></h5>

<p>No portion of the linguistic field of South America
offers greater confusion than that of the western
Amazonian region. The statements are so conflicting,
and the tribal changes apparently so rapid, that
we are at a loss to bring modern observations into
accord with older statements. Thus, I am entirely
unable to accept the linguistic classification of Hervas,
which certainly was based on the best information of
his day. As a matter of comparison I give it.</p>

<p>A slight examination of this classification suffices
to reveal its general inaccuracy. The Zaparos are
included in both the Encabellada and the Simigae<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
stocks. The latter is given both as a stock and as a
dialect of the Andoa. In fact, all three of the stocks
named belong together as dialects of one. The Pano
stock, as we now know it, appears scattered under
Cuniba, Urarina and Pana; and the arrangement is
incorrect in many other points. While it has a value
in preserving the names of some now missing tribes,
as a linguistic scheme it is wholly unsafe.</p>

<p>The <i>Zaparos</i> constitute one of the most extended
and numerous nations in the upper valley of the
Amazon. They dwell near or adjacent to the Jivaros
on the south, and as their name is variously spelled
Zaparos, Xeberos and Jeberos, they have at times been
confounded with them. They differ, however, not
only in language, but in appearance and temperament.
The Zaparos are lighter in color, smaller in stature,
with oblique eyes, large mouths, and expanded nostrils.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
Their disposition is indolent and easy tempered,
and their abilities inferior. This is seen in the
construction of their houses and the appearance of
their fields, which do not compare advantageously
with those of the Jivaros; but they display some ingenuity
in manufacturing clothing from the bark of a
species of <i>Ochroma</i>, and they are skillful in concocting
the urara poison, in making blow-pipes, and are daring
boatmen.</p>

<p>In 1632 they lived near the Omaguas, on the river
Curary, and their number was estimated by the missionaries
at 10,000. At present their main body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
dwells between the rivers Pastaza and Napo and
along the Marañon between the rivers Zamora and
Morona. In 1850 Osculati estimated their number at
over 20,000, which is certainly in excess of their
present representatives. The many small tribes into
which they are divided, and the confused orthography
of the names applied to them, render it difficult to
offer a satisfactory list. It seems tolerably certain
that the ancient “Andoas” were the Zaparos of the
upper Pastaza,<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> and equally sure that the Encabellada,
the Iebera, the Simigae and the Jinori languages,
all supposed by Hervas to be independent
stocks,<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> were spoken by members of the Zaparo
family. The Iquitos are another populous branch,
sometimes supposed to be distinct.</p>

<p>The Zaparo language is agreeable to the ear, partaking
of the phonetic character of the Brazilian
idioms. The Italian traveler, Osculati, has furnished
a very satisfactory account of it, both grammatical
and lexicographical,<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> and there are vocabularies by
other voyagers.</p>

<p>I offer the following alphabetic list of the sub-tribes
of the Zaparos, without attempting to define their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
several positions in the general district referred to:</p>

<p>On the mountain slope of the Cordillera, north of
the Zaparos and east of the Cañaris, are the <i>Jivaros</i>
(Givaros, Xivaros), a wild, warlike tribe, never
subjugated either by the Kechuas or the Spaniards.
Their homes are about the head-waters of the rivers
Pastaza, Santiago, and other affluents of the Marañon.
They are rather tall, of light color, with thin lips,
aquiline noses, straight eyes, prognathic jaws, hair
black or with a reddish tinge.</p>

<p>Some say their various bands number as many as
four hundred, named from the streams on which they
live. Most of them depend upon hunting and fishing,
others pursue agriculture and breed pigs. Their
weapons are the sarbacane, the lance, the bow and
the shield. They have developed a system of sound-signalling
or telegraphy by means of large wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
drums placed at certain distances apart, by beating
on which in a peculiar manner the advent of an
enemy, his number and direction, can be heralded
over hundreds of square miles in a few hours. The
Jivaros are celebrated for the preparation of human
heads by a process of boiling and drying so as to preserve
the hair and soft parts. Many of these trophy
heads have been brought to Europe, and their purpose
has led to some discussion. It appears that they
are prepared both as trophies of victory and out of
reverence to departed chiefs.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Their houses are built
solidly of wood, with wooden doors. They sleep
upon wooden frames, and construct tools of the same
material.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>The principal event in their history was their revolt
against the Spanish authorities in the year 1599.
They destroyed many settlements and the entire city
of Logroño, carrying the women into captivity.
Many of them had already been converted to Christianity,
and their rites are said still to preserve some
reminiscences of such teachings. In recent years
many of them have been civilized through the efforts
of Italian missionaries.</p>

<p>The language of this important nation, although
early studied, has as yet no printed literature. I have
found of it only the first five numerals, which do not
seem to have connection with any other tongue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
They are as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>Alza</i>; 2. <i>catuta</i>; 3. <i>kala</i>; 4. <i>ingatu</i>; 5. <i>aleyticlon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>From a study of proper names and ethnographic
traits, Dr. Hamy has expressed himself with great assurance
that the Jivaros belong to the Guarani group
of the Tupi stock;<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> but the above numerals do not
indicate such relationship, nor do I think that his
other arguments establish it. For the present they
must be considered an independent stock.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The eastern neighbors of the Jivaros are the scattered
bands of the <i>Maynas</i>, separated by Hervas into
two stocks, the Maina and the Chayavita, but so far
as I can learn, without sufficient reason. The language
is or was spoken at the mission of the Conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
on the upper Marañon and in the uplands around
Cerros de Mainas. It is singularly harsh and difficult.
The natives were wild, and lived by hunting and fishing.
Their earlier home was on the upper waters of
the Morona and Pastaza rivers.</p>

<p>The following bands are embraced in the</p>

<h6>MAINA LINGUISTIC STOCK.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></h6>

<p>On the Rio Javary there seem to be several independent
stocks. One of these is that of the <i>Yameos</i>,
who are found in the lower course of the river and
also further up the Marañon, near Nauta, and on the
Huallaga, where they are called Llameos, Yameos,
Lamas, or Lamistas. Formerly they were a numerous
and warlike nation, sharply divided into gentile
organizations, and carefully refraining from intermarriage
in the gens. At an early date we hear of
them between the Rio Tigre and the Napo. (Markham.)</p>

<p>The following sub-tribes are stated by various writers
to belong to the</p>

<h6>LAMA LINGUISTIC STOCK.</h6>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Pöppig describes them as agricultural and industrious,
and much given to trade and travel.</p>

<p>In appearance, they are small, dirty and Mongoloid,
sharply contrasting with the Indians of the Huallaga,
who are all tall, strong and well built, with good features.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>In conformity to old authorities, Markham classes
the <i>Ardas</i> as a sub-tribe of the Yameos. Their home
was between the rivers Napo and Masso. On the
latter they were in immediate contiguity to the
Massamaes (Coleti). There has been published a
<i>Doctrina</i> in their language, from which the Lord’s
Prayer is quoted by Ludewig.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> This version has no
resemblance to the Pater in Yamea contained in the
Mithridates; so for the present I leave the Ardas unclassified.</p>

<p>Higher up the river Javary are a number of tribes
speaking related dialects of what I shall call the <i>Peba</i>
stock, though there are some reasons to consider it a
corrupt dialect of the Omagua, and hence related to
the Tupi.</p>

<h6>PEBA LINGUISTIC STOCK.</h6>

<div class="list-container">
<ul>
<li><i>Caumaris</i>.</li>
<li><i>Cauwachis</i>.</li>
<li><i>Pacayas</i>.</li>
<li><i>Pebas</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>To this list I add the Yeguas, Yaguas or Yahuas,
found in the same vicinity, and remarkable for their
fine personal appearance, “the most perfect physical
type,” says M. Ordinaire, “of all the Indian races.”<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
The vocabulary of their language obtained by Castelnau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
shows unmistakable affinities to that of the
Pebas.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>On the Rio Chambira, adjacent to the Yameos and
Omaguas, dwelt in the early part of the last century
the <i>Itucales</i> and Varinas or Uarunas, who, according
to Coleti, spoke allied dialects. The Itucales were
noteworthy as the aptest and most biddable converts
obtained by the missionaries on the river. They were
agricultural and monogamous.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Hervas classes them
with the Musimos, the Mayorunas and the Barbudos,
under the Urarina language; but the last two are
members of the Pano stock.</p>

<p>The <i>Ticunas</i> (Tecunas, Tucunas) are found along
the lower Javary and the Solimoes, adjacent to the
Pebas. They wander about in a state of nakedness,
depending on hunting and fishing, and under a loose
control of the Brazilian government. Many of them
can converse in Kechua, though their own tongue is
of a different group. They are given to dances of a
sacred character, in which the actors appear in masks.
An operation allied to circumcision is practiced on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
infants of both sexes at the time of assigning them
names.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> One of the several tribes called “Orejones”
is thought by Pöppig to belong to the Ticunas.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>The tribes in the valley of the Huallaga were first
visited by Franciscan missionaries in 1676. In that
year Father Jose de Araujo converted a number of the
Hibitos (Xibitos) in the Upper Huallaga, and wrote
an <i>arte</i> of their language. He found it the same as
that of the Chunchos in the Sierra. Their neighbors
further down the river, the Cholones, speaking a different
idiom, were brought under the instruction of
Father Francisco Gutierrez, who composed a work on
their tongue. A century later we find these two nations
living together at the mission, counting 4800
souls, and occupying that portion of the province of
Cajamarquilla between 7° and 8° 30´ s. lat. They
were peaceable and agricultural, with fields of cotton
and food plants.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>This fair scene disappeared in the turbulent life of
the next generation, and when the traveler Pöppig
visited the Huallaga in 1834 he found the mission in
decay, and the natives, much reduced in numbers,
had resumed their wild life and again become savages.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
At present, along the main stream to the
north, are the Cocamillas, the Aguanteas, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Puinahuas. All these appear to be of the Tupi
stock, with dialects akin to the Cocama and Omagua.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p><i>The Panos.</i> When the missionaries first crossed
the Cordillera and explored the upper Ucayali river,
they found a number of related tribes, the principal
of whom were the Panos. By their traditions they
had moved from near the equator at the north. They
differed little in culture from their neighbors, and are
now nearly extinct. By the earlier writers they were
placed in relation to the Omaguas as members of the
Tupi stock,<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> but the researches of M. Raoul de la
Grasserie have vindicated for them an independent position.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
They are said to have possessed a form of
hieroglyphic writing, which they painted on a sort of
paper manufactured from vegetable fibre.</p>

<p>Some of the Mayorunas are reported as having
thick beards and white skins (Martius), but these peculiarities
are probably attributable to early admixtures
with the white race.</p>

<p>The largest of these tribes at present is that of the
Conibos, who constitute now the greater part of the
natives the traveler encounters on the Ucayali. In
appearance they have some resemblance to the Peruvians.
The nose is aquiline and prominent, the forehead
broad, the eye large, and the cheek bones not
prominent. In intelligence they are superior to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
neighbors, learning the Spanish language readily,
and proving themselves valuable house-servants.
They are apathetic, however, and none of the Panos
have shown any earnest desire to adopt a civilized
life.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>The Cashibos are the most savage tribe on the
Ucayali or its affluents, and are said to have the ugly
custom of eating their relations when they die, and
if this event is long delayed, the old men are killed.
But such is the power of ideas, that one of the obstacles
to their conversion is that they so much prefer
their bodies to become food for their relatives than a
feast for worms!<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>The Pacaguaras or Pacavaras, on the rivers Beni
and Mamore, classed by D’Orbigny as a separate
stock, belong among the Panos, as is clearly seen by
the vocabulary furnished by that traveler, and later
that by Mr. Heath.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> The easternmost branch of the
stock (not noted by M. de la Grasserie), are the
Canawarys (Canamarys), who live on the banks of
the Purus. Mr. Chandless heard that they were
related to the Conibos, and the few words he obtained
of their language prove the statement correct.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Chandless also says, “The Conibos are of the
same tribe as the Manitenerys of the river Purus,”
which would bring these latter also into the Pano stock.
The short vocabulary of their language which he
supplies does not bear out this assertion. Mr. Richard
Spruce considered that it proved them to be of
the Carib stock;<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> but to me it seems unmistakably a
member of the Arawak family, as will be seen from
the following analysis:</p>

<p>Mr. Chandless<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> met on the rivers Purus and Jurua
tribes of a stock whose tongue I have not been able
to connect with any other. They are represented
on the former stream by the Pammanas or Pammarys
(<i>pama-ouiri</i>, eaters of the <i>pama</i>, a kind of
berry), or Puru-purus (<i>piru-poru</i>, name of a skin
disease which prevails there), whose name has been
transferred to the river. These are believed by Martius
to be the same or allied to the Pamas, a tribe
who formerly lived on the Madeira, but were driven
thence by the Caripunas.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> On the Jurua are the
apparently related <i>Arauas</i> and Araicus. All these depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
on hunting and fishing, and are of migratory
habits. Some of the Pammanas are reported as light
in hue, with blue eyes and brown hair.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>Many tribes with names differing from the above
are recorded by the older writers as resident on these
rivers, but owing to the absence of linguistic material,
no identification is possible.</p>

<p>The close relationship of the Pammarys of the
Purus and the Arauas of the Jurua is shown by the
following comparison:</p>

<p>So far as known, I would place the following tribes

Mr. Chandless also supplies a short vocabulary.
It contains a few words in common with the
Pammary, but probably only borrowed by both from
the Arawak. The following will illustrate the two
tongues:</p>

<p>The Hypurinas on the Rio Acre (or Aquiri) belong
to the same tribe. They are said to be related to the
Chacobos and the Piros of the Ucayali. They are
without civilization. The women go naked, but the
men wear long purple robes, and both sexes pierce
the lips and nose. Some agriculture is carried on,
but hunting and fishing are the main sources of the
food supply.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>The total number of natives on the Purus and its
affluents was estimated by Colonel Labré, in 1885, at
40,000, “speaking forty or more different languages;”
but this last assertion we may take with large allowance.
Probably not over four or five stocks are represented.
The same explorer names nine tribes visited
by him on the river Ituxy. They are the: 1,
Caccharari; 2, Canamary; 3, Catauxi; 4, Guarayo;
5, Huatanary; 6, Hypurina; 7, Hyuma; 8, Pamana;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and 9, Pammary tribes.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>In this list, as elsewhere, the term <i>Guarayos</i> has
no ethnic significance. It is a Tupi word applied in
this Spanish form to various wild, uncivilized tribes.</p>

<h5><i>9. The Bolivian Highlands: the Chiquitos, Yurucares,
Mosetenas, Tacanas, Samucus, Canichanas
and others.</i></h5>

<p>On the Atlantic face of the Cordillera, in the easternmost
portion of Bolivia, where the head-waters of
the Madeira are known by the names of the Mamore,
the Guapai and the Beni, there is an astonishing variety
of linguistic stocks. It would seem that the
broken remnants of many diverse nations had sought
refuge in the deep vales and dense forests of this
region.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the Caribs were represented
here by the Palmellas, and the Arawaks by
the Moxos and Baures. South of the Moxos was
the extensive region of the <i>Chiquitos</i>, stretching
between south latitude 16° and 18°, and from the
upper affluents of the Paraguay river to the summit
of the Cordillera. On the south it adjoined the
Gran Chaco, and on the west the territory of the
Kechuas. They were a medium-sized, mild-mannered
people, mostly of little culture, depending on the
chase for food, but willingly adopting the agricultural
life recommended to them by the missionaries.
They were divided into a vast number of small roving
bands, the most important group of which were
the Manacicas, whose homes were near Lake Xaray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
about the head-waters of the Paraguay. Their
myths relating to a male and female deity and their
son reminded the Jesuits of the Christian Trinity.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
The Manacicas were agriculturists and remarkably
skilful potters. The villages they constructed were
surrounded with palisades and divided by broad
streets. The corpses of the dead were deposited in
underground vaults, and both property and rank
passed in the male line to the sons of the deceased.</p>

<p>The Chiquito language is interesting for its scope
and flexibility, being chiefly made up of generic particles
capable of indefinite combination.<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> It is singular
in having no numerals, not even as far as three.
Its four principal dialects were those of the Taos, the
Piñocos, the Manacicas and the Penoquies.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> It was
selected by the missionaries as the medium of instruction
for a number of the neighboring tribes.</p>

<p>Of such tribes there were many, widely different in
speech, manners and appearance from the Chiquitos.
Some of them are particularly noteworthy for their
un-Indian type. Thus, to the west of the Chiquitos,
on the banks of the rivers Mamore and Chavari, were
the Yurucares, the Tacanas and the Mosetenas, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
neighbors, and though not of one tongue, yet alike
in possessing a singularly white skin and fine features.
Their color is as light and as really white as
many southern Europeans, the face is oval, the nose
straight, fine, and often aquiline, the lips thin, the
cheek-bones not prominent, the eyes small, dark and
horizontal, the expression free and noble. They are
of pure blood, and the most important tribe of them
derived their name, <i>Yurucares</i>, white men, from
their Kechua neighbors before the conquest. They
are usually uncommonly tall (1.75), bold warriors,
lovers of freedom and given to a hunting life. The
women are often even taller and handsomer than the
men.</p>

<p>The traveler D’Orbigny suggested that this light
color arose from their residence under the shade of
dense forests in a hot and humid atmosphere. He
observed that many of them had large patches of
albinism on their persons.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>The branches of these stocks may be classed as
follows:</p>

<p>The Toromonas occupy the tract between the
Madre de Dios and the Madidi, from 12° to 13° south
latitude. According to D’Orbigny they are, together
with the Atenes, Cavinas, Tumupasas and Isuiamas,
members of one stock, speaking dialects of the <i>Tacana</i>
language. He was unable to procure a vocabulary of
it, and only learned that it was exceedingly guttural
and harsh.<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> From their position and their Kechua
name (<i>tuyu</i>), low or swamp land, I am inclined to
identify the Toromonas with the Tuyumiris or Pukapakaris,
who are stated formerly to have dwelt on the
Madre de Dios and east of the Rio Urubamba, and to
have been driven thence by the Sirineris (Tschudi).</p>

<p>According to recent authorities the Cavinas speak
the same tongue as the Araunas on the Madre de
Dios, which are separated from the Pacaguaras by the
small river Genichiquia;<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> and as the language of
the Toromonas is called in the earlier accounts of the
missions <i>Macarani</i>, I may make out the following
list of the members of the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>The Araunas are savage, and according to Heath
“cannibals beyond a doubt.” He describes them as
“gaunt, ugly, and ill formed,” wearing the hair
long and going naked.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> Colonel Labré, however,
who visited several of their villages in 1885, found
them sedentary and agricultural, with temples and
idols, the latter being geometrical figures of polished
wood and stone. Women were considered impure,
were not allowed to know even the names of the
gods, and were excluded from religious rites.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> The
Cavinas, on the other hand, are described by early
writers as constructing houses of stone.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> The Maropas,
on the east side of the river Beni near the little
town of Reyes, speak a dialect of Tacana as close to
it as Portuguese to Spanish. They are erroneously
classed as a distinct nation by D’Orbigny, who obtained
only a few words of their tongue. The Sapiboconas,
who lived at the Moxos Mission, and of whose
dialect Hervas supplies a vocabulary, are also a near
branch of the stock. We now have sufficient material
to bring these tribes into relation. With them I
locate the Lecos, the tribe who occupied the mission
of Aten, and are therefore called also Atenianos.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> At
present some civilized Lecos live at the mission of
Guanay, between the Beni and Titicaca; but we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
nothing of their language.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>The Tacana dialects present a number of verbal
analogies to Kechua and Aymara; so many in fact
that they testify to long inter-communion between
the stocks, though I think not to a radical identity.
I present a few:</p>

<p>The numerals above “two” have clearly been borrowed
from the Kechua-Aymara.</p>

<p>There are also a large number of verbal coincidences
between the Tacana and the Pano groups, but
not enough to allow us to suppose an original unity.</p>

<p>The <i>Samucus</i> (Zamucas) embraced a number of
sub-tribes dwelling on the northern border of the
Chaco, between 18° and 20° south latitude, and about
the river Oxuquis. They did not resemble the Chaco
stocks, as they were not vagrant hunters, but dwelt
in fixed villages, and pursued an agricultural life.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Their language was singularly sweet in sound, and was
called by D’Orbigny “the Italian of the forest.” They
included the following members:</p>

<h6>SAMUCU LINGUISTIC STOCK.</h6>

<div class="list-container">
<ul>
<li><i>Careras</i>.</li>
<li><i>Cayporotades</i>.</li>
<li><i>Coroinos</i>.</li>
<li><i>Cuculados</i>.</li>

<li><i>Potureros</i>.</li>
<li><i>Satienos</i>.</li>
<li><i>Tapios</i>.</li>
<li><i>Ugaronos</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Among these the Morotocos are said to have offered
the rare spectacle of a primitive gynocracy. The
women ruled the tribe, and obliged the men to perform
the drudgery of house-work. The latter were by no
means weaklings, but tall and robust, and daring tiger-hunters.
The married women refused to have more
than two children, and did others come they were
strangled.</p>

<p>On the river Mamore, between 13° and 14° of
south latitude, were the numerous villages of the
<i>Canichanas</i> or Canisianas. They were unusually
dark in complexion and ugly of features; nor did this
unprepossessing exterior belie their habits or temperament.
They were morose, quarrelsome, tricky
and brutal cannibals, preferring theft to agriculture,
and prone to drunkenness; but ingenious and not
deficient in warlike arts, constructing strong fortifications
around their villages, from which they would
sally forth to harass and plunder their peaceable
neighbors. By a singular anomaly, this unpromising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
tribe became willing converts to the teachings of the
Jesuits, and of their own accord gathered into large
villages in order to secure the presence of a missionary.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
Their language has no known affinities. It
is musical, with strong consonantal sounds, and like
some of the northern tongues, makes a distinction
between animate and inanimate objects, or those so
considered.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>Between 13° and 14° of south latitude, on the west
bank of the Rio Mamore, were the <i>Cayubabas</i> or
Cayuvavas, speaking a language without known affinities,
though containing words from a number of contiguous
tongues.<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The men are tall and robust, with
regular features and a pleasant expression. The missionaries
found no difficulty in bringing them into the
fold, but they obstinately retained some of their
curious ancient superstitions, as, for instance, that a
man should do no kind of work while his wife had her
monthly illness; and should she die, he would undertake
no enterprise of importance so long as he remained
a widower.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>Brief notices will suffice of the various other tribes,
many of them now extinct, who centered around the
missions of the Chiquitos and Moxos early in this
century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Apolistas</i> took their name from the river Apolo,
an affluent of the Beni, about south latitude 15°.
They were contiguous to the Aymaras, and had some
physical resemblance to them. From their position, I
suspect they belong in the Tacana group.</p>

<p>The <i>Chapacuras</i>, or more properly Tapacuras, were
on the Rio Blanco or Baures in the province of Moxos.
They called themselves <i>Huachis</i>, and the Quitemocas
are mentioned as one of their sub-tribes. Von Martius
thinks they were connected with the Guaches of Paraguay,
a mixed tribe allied to the Guaycuru stock of
the Chaco. The resemblance is very slight.</p>

<p>The <i>Covarecas</i> were a small band at the mission of
Santa Anna, about south latitude 17°. Their language
was practically extinct in 1831.</p>

<p>The <i>Curaves</i> and the <i>Curuminacas</i>, the former on
the Rio Tucubaca and the latter north of them near
the Brazil line, were said to have independent languages;
but both were extinct at the time of D’Orbigny’s
visit in 1831. The same was true of the <i>Corabecas</i>
and <i>Curucanecas</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Ites</i> or Itenes were upon the river Iten, an affluent
of the Mamore about 12° south latitude. They
were sometimes improperly called Guarayos, a term
which, like Guaycurus, Aucas, Yumbos and others,
was frequently applied in a generic sense by the
Spanish Americans to any native tribe who continued
to live in a savage condition.</p>

<p>The <i>Movimas</i> (Mobimas) occupied the shores of the
Rio Yacuma, and Rio Mamore about 14° south latitude.
In character and appearance they were similar
to the Moxos, but of finer physique, “seldom ever
under six feet,” says Mr. Heath. They are now civilized,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and very cleanly in their habits. The vocabularies
of their language show but faint resemblances
with any other.</p>

<p>The <i>Otuquis</i>, who in 1831 did not number over 150
persons, lived in the northeast part of the province of
Chiquitos near the Brazilian line. Their language was
nearly extinct at that time. The short vocabulary of
it preserved by D’Orbigny does not disclose connections
with other stocks, unless it be a distant affinity
with the Tacana group. This may be illustrated by
the following words:</p>

<p>It was the policy of the Jesuits in their missions in
this district to gather the tribes from the forest and
mountain into permanent settlements, and reduce as
far as possible the number of languages and dialects,
so as to facilitate instruction in religious teaching.
Shortly after this Order was expelled from their missions
(1767), an official report on their “reductions”
was printed in Peru, giving a list of the tribes at each
station, and the languages in use for instruction.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
From this scarce work I extract a few interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
particulars.</p>

<p>The province of Apolobamba is described as extending
about eighty leagues northeast-southwest,
east of the Cordillera, and west of the Rio Beni. The
languages adopted in it were the Leca, spoken by the
Lecos Indians at the mission of Aten, and the Maracani,
at the mission of Tumupasa, on the Rio Beni.
Forty-nine nations are named as belonging to the
mission of the Chiquitos, each of whom is stated to
have spoken a different language or dialect, though
all were instructed in their religious duties in Chiquito.
At the mission of Moxos twenty-nine tribes
are named as in attendance, but it had not been found
possible, such was the difference of their speech, to
manage with less than nine languages, to wit, the
Moxa, the Baure, the Mure, the Mobima, the Ocorona,
the Cayubaba, the Itonama and the Maracani.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>Of these tongues I have classed the Leca and Maracani
as dialects of the Takana, not from comparison
of vocabularies, for I have seen none of either, but
from the locations of the tribes speaking them. The
Moxa and Baure are dialects of the Arawak stock.
The Mura is a branch of the Tupi, spoken by the
powerful tribe of the Muras on the Medeira and Amazon,
who distinctly recalled in tradition their ancestral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
home in the west.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> The Chiquito, the Mobima,
the Caniciana (Canichana), the Cayubaba, the Itonama
and the Ocorona remain so far irreducible stocks.
Vocabularies of the first five have been preserved, but
nothing of the Ocorona. It is probably identical with
the Rocorona, in which Professor Teza has published
some texts.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> I have not been able to identify it
with any other tongue. Hervas unites both with the
Herisebocona as a single stock.<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<h4>2. THE PAMPEAN REGION.</h4>

<p>South of the dividing upland which separates the
waters of the Amazon from those which find their
way to the Rio de la Plata, the continent extends in
broad level tracts, watered by numerous navigable
streams and rich in game and fish. Its chief physical
features are the wooded and rolling Chaco in the
north, the treeless and grassy Pampas to the south,
and the sterile rocky plains of Patagonia still further
toward the region of cold. In the west the chain of
the Cordilleras continues to lift its summits to an inaccessible
height until they enter Patagonia, when
they gradually diminish to a range of hills.</p>

<p>The tribes of all this territory, both east and west
of the Andes, belong ethnographically together, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
not with the Peruvian stocks. What affinities they
present to others to the north are with those of the
Amazonian regions.</p>

<h5><i>1. The Gran Chaco and its Stocks. The Guaycurus,
Lules, Matacos and Payaguas. The Charruas,
Guatos, Calchaquis, etc.</i></h5>

<p>The great streams of the Parana and Paraguay offer
a natural boundary between the mountainous country
of southern Brazil and the vast plains of the Pampas
formation. In their upper course these rivers form
extensive marshes, which in the wet season are transformed
into lakes on which tangled masses of reeds
and brushwood, knitted together by a lush growth of
vines, swim in the lazy currents as floating islands.
These were the homes of some wild tribes who there
found a secure refuge, the principal of whom were the
Caracaras, who came from the lower Parana, and were
one of the southernmost offshoots of the Tupi family.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>For five hundred miles west of the Parana and extending
nearly as far from north to south, is a wide,
rolling country, well watered, and usually covered
with dense forests, called El Gran Chaco.<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Three
noble rivers, the Pilcomayo, the Vermejo and the
Salado, intersect it in almost parallel courses from
northwest to southeast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>Abounding in fish and game and with a mild
climate, the Chaco has always been densely peopled,
and even to-day its native population is estimated at
over twenty thousand. But the ethnology of these
numerous tribes is most obscure. The Jesuit missionaries
asserted that they found eight totally different
languages on the Rio Vermejo alone,<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> and the
names of the tribes run up into the hundreds.</p>

<p>As is generally the case with such statements, distant
dialects of the same stock were doubtless mistaken
for radically distinct tongues. From all the
material which is accessible, I do not think that the
Chaco tribes number more than five stocks, even including
those who spoke idioms related to the Guarani
or Tupi. The remainder are the Guaycuru, the
Mataco, the Lule and the Payagua. This conclusion
is identical with that reached by the Argentine
writer, Don Luis J. Fontana, except that he considers
the Chunipi independent, while I consider that it is a
member of the Mataco stock.</p>

<p>One of the best known members of the <i>Guaycuru</i>
stock was the tribe of the Abipones, whose manners
and customs were rendered familiar in the last century
through the genial work of the Styrian missionary,
Martin Dobrizhoffer.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> They were an equestrian people,
proud of their horsemanship and their herds, and
at that time dwelt on the Paraguay river, but by
tradition had migrated from the north.</p>

<p>The Guaycurus proper were divided into three
gentes (<i>parcialidades</i>) located with reference to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
cardinal points. On the north were the Epicua-yiqui;
on the west the Napin-yiqui, and on the
south the Taqui-yiqui. Their original home was on
the Rio Paraguay, two hundred leagues from its
mouth, but later they removed to the banks of the
Pilcomayo. Their system was patriarchal, the sons inheriting
direct from the father, and they were divided
into hereditary castes, from which it was difficult to
emerge. These were distinguished by different colors
employed in painting the skin. The highest caste,
the <i>nabbidigan</i>, were distinguished by black.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>The Abipones were almost entirely destroyed early
in this century by the Tobas and Mbocobis,<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> and
probably at present they are quite extinct. The
Tobas are now the most numerous tribe in the Chaco,
and their language the most extended.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> They remain
savage and untamable, and it was to their ferocity
that Dr. Crévaux, the eminent French geographer
and anthropologist, fell a victim in recent
years. The dialects of the Abipones, Mbocobis and
Tobas were “as much alike as Spanish and Portuguese”
(Dobrizhoffer).</p>

<p>The Guachis speak a rather remote dialect of the
stock, but undoubtedly connected with the main
stem. According to the analogy of many of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
words and the tenor of tradition, they at one time
lived in the Bolivian highlands, in the vicinity of the
Moxos and Chiquitos. It is probable that they are
now nearly extinct, as for several generations infanticide
has been much in vogue among them, prompted,
it is said, by superstitious motives. Forty years ago
an inconspicuous remnant of them were seen by Castelnau
and Natterer in the vicinity of Miranda.<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>The Malbalas, who were a sub-tribe of the Mbocobis,
dwelling on the Rio Vermejo, are described as
light in color, with symmetrical figures and of kindly
and faithful disposition. Like most of the Chaco
tribes, they were monogamous, and true to their
wives.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>The Terenos and the Cadioéos still survive on the
upper Paraguay, and are in a comparatively civilized
condition. The latter manufacture a pottery of unusually
excellent quality.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>On the authority of Father Lozano I include in
this stock the Chichas-Orejones, the Churumatas,
that branch of the Mataguayos called Mataguayos
Churumatas (from the frequent repetition of the syllable
<i>chu</i> in their dialect), the Mbocobis and Yapitalaguas,
whose tongues were all closely related to
the Toba;<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> while Dr. Joao Severiano da Fonseca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
has recently shown that the Quiniquinaux is also a
branch of this stock.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Lules</i> are a nation which has been a puzzle
for students of the ethnography of the Chaco. They
were partly converted by the celebrated Jesuit missionary
and eminent linguist, Father Alonso de Barcena,
in 1690, who wrote a grammar of their language,
which he called the Tonicote. The Jesuit
historian of Paraguay, Del Techo, states that three
languages were spoken among them, the Tonicote,
the Kechua and the Cacana, which last is a Kechua
term from <i>caca</i>, mountain, and in this connection
means the dialect of the mountaineers. Barcena’s
converts soon became discontented and fled to the
forests, where they disappeared for thirty years or
more. About 1730, a number of them reappeared near
the Jesuit mission of the Chaco, and settled several
towns on the rivers Valbuena and Salado. There
their language was studied by the missionaries. A
grammar of it was composed by Machoni,<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> and a vocabulary
collected by the Abbé Ferragut.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> Meanwhile
the work of Barcena had disappeared, and the
Abbé Hervas expressed a doubt whether the Lule of
Machoni was the same as that of his predecessor.
He advanced the opinion that the ancient Lule was
the Cacana; that the modern were not the descendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
of the ancient Lules, and that the Mataras of the
Chaco were the Tonicotes to whom Barcena was
apostle.<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>The missionary Lozano to some extent clears up
this difficulty. He states that the Lules or Tonicotes
were divided into the greater and lesser Lules, and it
is only the latter to which the name properly belonged.
The former were divided into three bands,
the Isistines, the Oristines, and the Toquistines.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
None of these latter existed under these names at the
close of the last century, and at present no tribe
speaking the Lule of Machoni is known in the Chaco.
The language has evident affinities both with the
Vilela and the Mataco,<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> but also presents many independent
elements. The statement of Hervas, copied
by various subsequent writers,<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> that the ancient or
greater Lules spoke the Cacana, and that this was a
different stock from the Lule of Machoni, lacks proof,
as we have no specimen of the Cacana, and not even
indirect knowledge of its character. Indeed, Del
Techo says definitely that the missionaries of the
earliest period, who were familiar with the Lule of
that time, had to employ interpreters in ministering
to the Cacanas.<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>The modern Vilelas live on the Rio Salado, between
25° and 26° south latitude. I find in it so many
words of such character that I am inclined to take it
as the modern representative of the Lule of Machoni,
though corrupted by much borrowing. When we
have a grammar of it, the obscurity will be cleared up.</p>

<p>A comparison of the Vilela with the Chunipi,
(Chumipy, Sinipi or Ciulipi,) proves that they are
rather closely related, and that the Chunipi is not an
independent tongue as has often been stated. In view
of this, I include it in the Lule dialects.</p>

<p>The third important stock is that of the <i>Matacos</i>.
It is still in extensive use on the Rio Vermejo, and
we have a recent and genial description of these people
and their language from the pen of the Italian
traveler, Giovanni Pelleschi.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> They are somewhat
small in size, differing from the Guaycurus in this
respect, who are tall. Their homes are low huts
made of bushes, but they are possessed of many small
arts, are industrious, and soon become conversant
with the use of tools. Their hair is occasionally
wavy, and in children under twelve, it is often
reddish. The eyes are slightly oblique, the nose
large, straight and low. Like all the Chaco Indians,
they do not care for agriculture, preferring a subsistence
from hunting and fishing, and from the product<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
of their horses and cattle. What few traditions they
have indicate a migration from the east.</p>

<p>The term Mataguayos was applied to some of this
stock as well as to some of the Guaycurus. The
former included the Agoyas, the Inimacas or Imacos,
and the Palomos, to whom the Jesuit Joseph Araoz
went as missionary, and composed a grammar and
dictionary of their dialect. He describes them as exceedingly
barbarous and intractable.<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> The Tayunis
had at one time 188 towns, and the Teutas 46 towns.
This was in the palmy days of the Jesuit reductions.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>
Both these extensive tribes are classed by D’Orbigny
with the Matacos.</p>

<p>According to the older writers the <i>Payaguas</i> lived
on the river Paraguay, and spoke their tongue in two
dialects, the Payagua and the Sarigue. Von Martius,
however, denies there ever was such a distinct people.
The word <i>payagua</i>, he remarks, was a generic term
for “enemies,” and was applied indiscriminately to
roving hordes of Guaycurus, Mbayas, etc.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>The Payaguas, however, are mentioned distinctly
by the early missionaries as a nation with peculiar
language and habits. They differed from their neighbors
as being aquatic, not equestrian. They were
singularly skilful boatmen and had a mythology
apart from the other tribes, “worshipping the devil
under the figure of a great bird.”<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> There is also a
manuscript in the Library of the American Philosophical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Society, written in the middle of the last
century, describing the visit of a missionary to the
Payaguas, at that time resident near Santa Fé in
Paraguay. He accuses them as given to revolting
vices and utterly barbarous.<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>The statement of Von Martius that the nation has
entirely disappeared is incorrect, as quite recently a
vocabulary of it has been obtained by Don Luis de
Fontana, which shows it to be distinct both from the
Guaycuru and any other known stock.<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>Among the independent Chaco stocks, D’Orbigny
classes the <i>Lenguas</i>, who in 1828 lived, about 300 in
number, near Corrientes.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> Von Martius believed
they were a branch of the Guaycurus.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> There is
ample evidence, however, that they were a wandering
branch of the Chiquitos of Bolivia. The missionary,
J. P. Fernandez, who visited them about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
century before D’Orbigny, says expressly that they
spoke the same tongue as the Chiquitos;<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> and the
statement of Hervas that the similarities of their
words to the Chiquito arose from borrowed expressions
is not well founded.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Charruas</i> were a barbarous nation living in the
extensive plains which stretch from the banks of the
Parana to the sea coast. They were savage and courageous,
without fixed homes, and skilled in the use of the
bola. One of their customs was to cut off a joint of a
finger on the death of a relative, and there were few
of the adults that were not thus maimed.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> In appearance
they were usually large in size, heavily built, with
big heads and broad faces, narrow noses, small eyes
and large mouths. Their color was dark.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<p>The members of this family as recorded by the early
writers, especially Hervas, are as follows:</p>

<h6>CHARRUA LINGUISTIC STOCK.</h6>

<div class="list-container">
<ul>
<li><i>Bohanes</i>, on the Paraguay near the Rio Negro (extinct).</li>
<li><i>Chanes</i>, adjacent to the Bohanes.</li>

<li><i>Minuanes</i>, between the Uruguay and Parana.</li>
<li><i>Yaros</i>, on east bank of Uruguay (extinct).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Dr. Paul Ehrenreich describes them as they are to-day,
splendid riders and daring soldiers, but faithless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and tricky;<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> so they have not much improved since
Father Chomé in 1730 stigmatized them as <i>francs
voleurs de grand chemin</i>.<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Guatos</i> or Vuatos were accolents of the upper
Paraguay and Araguay, and had fixed settlements near
Albuquerque. Travelers report them as an unusually
handsome people. They are well-built, light in hue,
with Roman noses and regular features, and the men
with a well-developed beard on lip and chin. This
appearance does not belie their intelligence, which is
above the average. Polygamy prevails to an uncommon
extent. Von Martius thought that they were of
a northeastern origin, connected perhaps with the
Malalis of Bahia, who are a Tapuya people.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> There
may have been some admixture, as from a small vocabulary

<p>A recent writer does not give so favorable an opinion
of this people. He found them living about the
junction of the Rio San Lorenzo with the Rio Paraguay,
and in a depraved condition. Girls who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
not more than five or six years old were used by the
men as wives. Sterility and premature decrepitude
were the natural consequences.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>On the western border of the Chaco, in the provinces
of Tucuman and Catamarca, resided the <i>Calchaquis</i>, a
tribe interesting as the only one in the South Atlantic
Group who constructed walls of cut stone. At least,
such are found in their country, as for instance, one
about thirty miles from Andalgala, where there is a
well-constructed dry wall about ten feet high, enclosing
a space nearly a mile in diameter, evidently once a
walled city. Stone built tombs are also frequent, from
which the rifler is rewarded with mummies, ornaments
of impure gold, and small idols of copper. But I
doubt if the Calchaquis developed any such ripe arts
as these. History tells us that they voluntarily accepted
the rule of the Incas about the middle of the
fifteenth century, and that their land became part of
the <i>Collasuyu</i> or southern district of the empire. All
these remains have a distinct impress of Kechua art,
and we may be sure that their inspiration was throughout
Peruvian.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>The earliest missionaries depict the Calchaquis
with curious usages and with a certain barbaric
splendor. A widow became the wife of her husband’s
brother, as of old in Israel. So long as she was a
virgin, a girl could dress in the gaudiest colors, but
once <i>prostrato pudore</i>, as the monk delicately puts it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
she must change to sober weeds. Their ornaments
were of silver and copper, and the nobles wore a circlet
of gold and brilliant feathers. Their seasons of
mourning were accompanied with the most violent
orgies. Over the dead they raised heaps of stones,
and held that the souls became stars.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>We have no specimen of the language of the Calchaquis,
although a grammar of it was written by the
Jesuit, Alonso de Barcena, and perhaps published. It
is called the Katamareño or Cacana tongue, terms derived
from the Kechua. The proper names, however,
which have been preserved in it indicate that it was
different from the Kechua.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> I have already referred
(page 227) to Von Tschudi’s suggestion that it survives
in the modern Atacameño.</p>

<p>From the few specimens of skulls which have been
examined, the Calchaquis appear allied to the Aucanian
stock,<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> and it may be that further research will
prove them a branch of the Araucanians.</p>

<p>The following tribes are mentioned by old writers as
members of the</p>

<p>The learned Barcena also prepared a grammar of
the Natixana or Mogana language, spoken by the
<i>Naticas</i>, whom we find mentioned by later authorities
as neighbors of the Calchaquis in the government
of Santa Fé.<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> They apparently belonged among the
Chaco tribes. Barcena adds that nine different
tongues were spoken in the district of Cordova,
among which were the Sanavirona and Indama,
which had not been learned by the missionaries.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<h5><i>2. The Pampeans and Araucanians.</i></h5>

<p>South of the Gran Chaco, say from south latitude
35°, begins the true Pampas formation. This, according
to the geologist Burmeister, is not a marine
deposit, but the result of fluvial overflows and dust
storms. It is diluvial and quaternary, and overlies
the Patagonian formation, which is marine and early
Pleistocene. The pampas are in parts wide grassy
plains, like the prairies of the upper Mississippi valley;
in parts they are salt deserts, in parts more or less
wooded. With little variety, this scenery reaches from
the Chaco to the Rio Negro, S. lat. 40°. Nearly the
whole of this territory was occupied by one linguistic
stock. It is the same which is found in Chili, where
its most prominent members are the Araucanians.</p>

<p>Which was the course of migration, whether from
the Pacific coast to the Pampean plains or the reverse,
is not positively decided, but I am inclined to believe
it was the latter. The ancestors of the Araucanians
would not willingly have crossed the barren wastes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
of the desert of Atacama; there are evidences of a
different people inhabiting Chili before they possessed
it, and we have traces that they had not obtained full
possession of that country at its discovery. This
view does not deny subsequent migrations of the
Araucanians into the Pampas under the pressure of
the Spanish invasion.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> In such moving they were
simply returning to the traditional homes of their
ancestors. As the name of the whole stock, I adopt
the word Aucanian, from the Araucanian verb <i>aucani</i>,
to be wild, indomitable, from which are derived the
tribal names Aucanos and Aucas, occurring on both
sides of the Andes.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>The Pampeans are principally nomadic hordes wandering
from pasture to pasture with their horses,
cattle and sheep. Their transitory encampments,
called <i>tolderias</i>, are pitched by the side of some pond
or stream. There their low tents made of dried horse
skins are grouped confusedly, one to each family.
Their food is chiefly horse flesh and mutton, often
eaten raw. They raise no vegetables, and dislike
agriculture. They carry on, however, many small
industries, tan and dye leather, which they work up
into boots and horse furniture, and forge with skill
iron heads for their long lances, and knives for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
chase, while the women trim the ostrich skins into
rugs, and weave wool into blankets and ponchos,
highly prized for their serviceable qualities.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> These
products are bought up by the merchants in the cities,
and thus the tribe is supplied with what it most
prizes from European markets.</p>

<p>These roving hordes have no particular names.
They are referred to as the northern, eastern or western
peoples by the Aucanian terms having these significations,
Puelches, Moluches, Huiliches. Besides
these, there are the Ranqueles on the Rio Quinto,
directly west of Buenos Ayres, who are said to have
immigrated from Chili,<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> and the Querandies, now
probably extinct, who once dwelt near that city.</p>

<p>Those living on the eastern slopes of the Andes,
about the city of Mendoza, and in the ancient province
of Cuyo, are described as taller and stronger than
the Araucanians of Chili, and as claiming descent
from the Pampean tribes.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> They were locally
known as Guarpes, and spoke dialects called the
Allentiac and the Milcocayac, not distant from the
Pampean proper, concerning which some grammatical
description has been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Few of the Pampean tribes have been induced to
accept civilization or Christianity. They still believe
in their good spirit, <i>Chachoa</i>, and in one of evil or
misfortune, <i>Gualicho</i>; they continue to obey their
priests or medicine men; and the resting places of the
dead are regarded with superstitious awe. Marriage
among them, while it has the appearance of violence,
is really carried out with the consent of the girl and
her parents, for a sum agreed upon.</p>

<p>The Molu-Che or Manzaneros are said to be the best
of the Pampeans. They are sedentary and have extensive
orchards of apples and flocks of sheep to the
north of the Rio Limay. They have well-cut features,
fresh light complexion, black fine hair, and
their women are considered really handsome.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>The Araucanians of Chili, known as singularly bold
warriors who defied successfully the Incas, and gave
the Spaniards the greatest trouble, occupy the Pacific
coast from south latitude 25° to about 43°, and number
about 20,000. In physical appearance they resemble
the Pampeans, and present marked differences
from both the Kechuas of Peru and the Tapuyas of
Brazil, having high, brachycephalic skulls,<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> and a
clear copper color of skin. They are of moderate
stature, but muscular, with black hair, round faces,
small eyes, and small feet and hands. They are divided
locally into northern and southern tribes, but
there is little difference in dialects. Their tongue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the <i>Chilidungu</i>, has been extravagantly lauded by
some who have studied it, and one worthy missionary
was so enamored with it that he published a grammar
and dictionary of it in Europe, that it might be introduced
as the learned language there, to supersede
the Latin:<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> it certainly is harmonious and flexible.</p>

<p>The Araucanians did not at any time rise in culture
above the level of the Iroquois and Algonquins
in the northern continent. It is true that in the
tombs in their country we discover fine specimens of
pottery, some good work in bronze, gold, copper and
silver, and beautiful specimens of polished stone implements.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
But if one examines closely the art-forms
of these relics, he can not fail to recognize in
them the potent inspiration of the Inca civilization;
and we may be sure that if they were not directly
booty from that nation, they were the products of its
trained workmen, and are not to be put to the credit
of Aucanian industry.</p>

<p>The Pacific coast of Patagonia, gashed by ancient
glaciers into deep fiords and rocky islands, harbors
various tribes whose affinities are uncertain. The
most curious of them would seem to be the <i>Chonos</i> or
Chunos, or Cuncones. They lived south of the archipelago
of Chiloe, and are described as having red hair,
a light olive complexion, and of mild and friendly
manners. They raised a breed of dogs (perhaps guanacos),
and wove their clothing from its coarse long
hair.</p>

<p>This account comes to us from as far back as
1619, when the first missionaries visited them,<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> and
these traits cannot therefore be attributed to intermixture
with Europeans. They are not peculiar in
these respects. Similar traits are reported of the
Boroas, a tribe in one of the valleys of central Chili;<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
and I have already referred to the red hair of the boys
among the Matacos of the Gran Chaco. Perhaps it
was not unusual among these nations, as I can in no
other way explain the strange idea of the poet Ercilla
the Homer of the Araucanian Conquest, that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
people were descendants of the Frisians of North
Holland!<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>The language of the Chonos is said to be quite different
from that of the Araucanians. Pöppig believed
it to be a distant dialect of the same stock.
Some recent travelers assert that they are now extinct,
but Dr. C. Martin informs us that the original
inhabitants of the Chonos Islands, who were the
“Huaihuenes” Indians, were transported in 1765 to
the island of Chaulañec, where their posterity still
survive.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<h5><i>3. The Patagonians and Fuegians.</i></h5>

<p>The Patagonians call themselves Chonek or Tzoneca,
or Inaken (men, people), and by their Pampean
neighbors are referred to as Tehuel-Che, southerners.
They do not, however, belong to the Aucanian stock,
nor do they resemble the Pampeans physically. They
are celebrated for their stature, many of them reaching
from six to six feet four inches in height, and
built in proportion.<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> In color they are a reddish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
brown, and have aquiline noses and good foreheads.
They care little for a sedentary life, and roam the
coast as far north as the Rio Negro. They are not
without some religious rites, and are accustomed to
salute the new moon, and at the beginning of any
solemn undertaking to puff the smoke of their pipes
to the four cardinal points, just as did the Algonquins
and Iroquois.<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>Their language differs wholly from the Araucanian,
though it has borrowed many words from it. An interesting
fact illustrating its stability in spite of their
roving life has been brought out by Ramon Lista.
He has compared its present form with the vocabulary
of it given by Pigafetta in his voyage in 1520, and
shows that in the intervening generations it has undergone
scarcely any change.<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>Von Martius believed that a connection between
the Patagonian and the Tapuya stocks could be
shown, and gives a tabular comparison of the two.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>
I have extended this by means of Ramon Lista’s
vocabulary of the former and Dr. Ehrenreich’s corrected
forms of the Tapuya, and conclude that the
resemblances are illusory, depending on incorrect
orthography of the sounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>About the beginning of the last century the tribes
known as Poyas (<i>Pey-yuy</i>) and Reyes (<i>Rey-yuy</i>) were
collected at a Mission established on Lake Nahuelhuapi,
about south latitude 42°. Hervas reports them
as speaking a language radically different from the
Araucanian, and probably they should be classed with
the Tzonecas.<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>On the inhospitable shores of Tierra del Fuego
there dwell three nations of diverse stock, but on
about the same plane of culture. One of these is the
<i>Yahgans</i> or Yapoos, on the Beagle canal; the second
is the <i>Onas</i> or Aonik, to the north and east of these;
and the third the <i>Alikulufs</i>, to the north and west.</p>

<p>Of these the Yahgans are the best known, through
the efforts of the English missionaries who have reduced
their language to writing. It is a polysyllabic,
agglutinative tongue, with both pre- and suffixes, and
is extremely rich in expressions for the ordinary
needs of their life. The verb has four numbers, a
singular, dual, trial and plural. It does not seem in
any way related to the Aucanian stock.<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>The tongue of the Onas, who are known as the
<i>Yakanna-Cunni</i>, is apparently connected with the
Tsoneca or Patagonian, which people they also resemble
in stature and physical traits.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fuegians are generally quoted as a people on
the lowest round of the ladder of culture; and so they
are painted by many observers. They have no government,
they can count only to three, ordinary family
affection is not observable, and even mothers manifest
a lack of love for their offspring. Their shelters are
wretched, and they go almost naked in a climate
which is both cold and damp.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they display singular ingenuity
in their utensils for hunting and fishing; they use the
sling, the club, the bow, the bola and the lance; the
women weave reed baskets so firmly that they will hold
water, and their bark canoes are light and seaworthy.</p>

<p>In hunting they have the service of a native dog
which they have trained, and whose welfare they
look after with sedulous attention. Though devoid
of idols and external rites of worship, they manifest
in many ways a sense of religion. Thus the relations
of the sexes are surrounded with ceremonies of fasting
and bathing, to neglect which would entail misfortunes,
and the name of the dead is not pronounced
out of superstitious awe. The songs and legends of
the Yahgans show some imaginative power. Many
of them relate to the marvelous achievements of the
national hero, <i>Umoara</i>, who appears to be a wholly
mythical individual. Their strongest passion would
seem to be for personal adornment, and for this purpose
shells, vegetable beads, bright pebbles and variegated
feathers, are called into requisition.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>These traits are not those of an enfeebled intellect,
and an examination of their physical powers supports
a favorable opinion of their capacities. Some of them
are unusually tall and strong, especially those on the
east coast. Their skulls are mesocephalic and prognathic,
and their brains, which have been examined
most carefully by a German anatomist, show not a
single point of inferiority to the average European
brain.<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>From examinations which have been carried on in
the numerous shell-heaps which line the shores, there
is no evidence that any other people ever occupied
the islands. Skulls and relics are such as those of
the present inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> The total number of these
is about 8000, nearly equally divided between the
tribes named.</p>

<p>The classification of the smaller tribes under the
above stocks is not yet complete. So far as I can
make it out, it is as follows:</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The opinion has been advanced by Dr. Deniker of
Paris,<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> that the Fuegians represent the oldest type or
variety of the American race. He believes that at
one time this type occupied the whole of South
America south of the Amazon, and that the Tapuyas
of Brazil and the Fuegians are its surviving members.
This interesting theory demands still further evidence
before it can be accepted. It is not confirmed by
such linguistic comparisons as I have been able to
institute.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LINGUISTIC_APPENDIX">LINGUISTIC APPENDIX</h2>

<p>The linguistic classification of the American tribes
is at present imperfect in many regions on account
of the incomplete information about their
tongues. A proper comparison of languages or dialects
includes not merely the vocabulary, but the
grammatical forms and the phonetic variations which
the vocal elements undergo in passing from one form
of speech to another. In some respects, the morphology
is more indicative of relationship than the lexicon
of tongues; and it is in these grammatical
aspects that we are peculiarly poorly off when we approach
American dialects. Yet it is also likely that
the tendency of late years has been to underestimate
the significance of merely lexical analogies. The
vocabulary, after all, must be our main stand-by in
such an undertaking.</p>

<p>For that reason I have thought it worth while to
bring together a short list of common words and
show their renderings in a number of American
tongues. Inasmuch as the languages north of Mexico&mdash;those
in the United States and Canada&mdash;have
been frequently studied and are readily accessible in
published books, I have confined my specimens to
the tongues of the central and southern regions of the
continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>The words I have selected for the vocabulary are
those which I think would be most likely to indicate
relationship, when such existed. But as every comparative
linguist is aware, neither these nor any
words are free from the risk of ambiguity and equivocation.
Thus, in many languages there are two or
three different terms for “man,” as <i>homo</i>, <i>vir</i> or
<i>male</i>; “woman” is <i>wife</i> or <i>female</i>; “sun” and
“moon” are often merely descriptive terms or synonyms
of day, light, night and darkness; the parts
of the body have in American tongues the personal
possessive noun prefixed or suffixed; what is worse,
the terms for such may differ with the person, as in
Kechua, where the word for “eye,” “arm,” etc.,
differ as it is <i>my</i> or <i>thy</i> eye, etc. “Hand” and
“arm,” “foot” and “leg,” are frequently not discriminated,
the corresponding words meaning properly
“upper extremity,” “lower extremity,” etc.;
and so on for almost every word that could be chosen.</p>

<p>The proper inference to draw from these facts is,
not that a comparison of vocabularies is worthless or
nearly so, but just the contrary. Where we find that
a short vocabulary, imperfect for the above reasons,
and still more so for the general ignorance of linguistics
on the part of collectors, and the varying
values they give to the alphabets employed, yet reveals
identities with others, we are justly authorized
to consider such analogies as highly significant and
suggestive of profounder comparisons.</p>

<p>The above vocabularies illustrate the extension of the Yuma
stock to the southward. The Cochimi and Guaicuru are remote
dialects, but of positive affinities. The Yuma words which I have
added for comparison are principally from the Mohave dialect, and
are taken from the vocabularies published by the “U. S. Geographical
Surveys west of the 100th Meridian.”</p>

<p>The Seri words are chiefly from the satisfactory vocabulary obtained
by the late John Russell Bartlett. The relationship of the
dialect to the Yuma stock is evident.</p>

<p>The eight dialects which I give from the extensive Uto-Aztecan
stock will illustrate the relationship of its members. The words
marked M. in the Ute or Shoshonian vocabulary belong to the
Moqui dialect, which appears to approach nearer the Aztecan
branch than the speech of the northern tribes. The Tepehuana
words are from the vocabulary obtained by M. Tarayre, and published
in his <i>Explorations</i> (see <i>anté</i>, p. <a href="#Page_136">136</a>). I have placed the
geographical extremes, the Nahuatl and the Ute, side by side, to
illustrate the really striking similarity of these dialects, the one
current on the Columbia river, the other extending to Chiriqui
lagoon, near the Isthmus of Panama. Buschmann, in his works
already referred to (<i>anté</i>, p. <a href="#Page_119">119</a>), cites numerous other examples.</p>

<p>Still more substantial proof of the unity of this stock is furnished
by the comparative grammar of its different members. These
present various phases of morphological development, but always
on the same lines. The Nahuatl is much the higher of them all,
and in some of its forms attains to a truly inflectional character,
as has been shown by Professor Steinthal.</p>

<p>The Totonaco is spoken in two diverse dialects by the inhabitants
of the plains and the uplands. The difference is not so great as
appears in the written tongue, as they are mutually intelligible.</p>

<p>A number of works on the Tarascan language have recently been
edited or written by Dr. Nicolas Leon, of Morelia, Michoacan, so
that there is abundant material for the study of the tongue.</p>

<p>The Otomi presents so many sounds unfamiliar to the European
ear that the attempt to represent it by our alphabets can be only
remotely accurate. I have a very extensive MS. dictionary of the
tongue, based on the <i>Vocabulario Mexicano</i> of Molina.</p>

<p>In the above vocabularies the relation of the Zoque to the Mixe
is more clearly shown than that of the Zapotec to the Mixtec. A
more extended comparison of the two latter has been instituted by
Pimentel in his work on the languages of Mexico, which appears
to strengthen the belief that they belong to the same stock. Prof.
Friedrich Müller, however, continues to regard them as separate
stocks (<i>Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft</i>, Bd. II., Ab. I., s. 298,
sq.). The question is discussed with fullness in the introduction,
by Dr. Nicholas Leon, to the <i>Arte del Idioma Zapoteco</i>, of Juan de
Cordova (ed. Morelia, 1886), to which the student is referred. I
think the evidence is sufficient to regard them as allied idioms.
The Zapotec of the mountains, <i>Zapoteco serrano</i>, differs considerably
from that which is given above.</p>

<p>The Chinantec is included in the Zapotec stock by Pimentel, who
follows the dictum of Hervas, confessedly without examination
(<i>Lenguas Indigenas de Mexico</i>, Tom. III., cap. 37). This was not
the opinion of Dr. Berendt, who has compared both tongues, and
a comparison of the short vocabularies which I give shows only one
word, that for “foot,” which is identical in both.</p>

<p>The Huaves, who claim a migration from the south, do not reveal
a connection in their language with any of the southern stocks.</p>

<p>The Maya of the Vocabulary is the pure tongue as spoken in Yucatan.
Its various dialects have been carefully studied by Berendt,
Stoll and others. The most corrupt is probably the Chaneabal of
Chiapas, of which I gave a short analysis in the <i>American Anthropologist</i>,
Jan., 1888.</p>

<p>The above four vocabularies are taken from MS. material in my
possession collected by E. G. Squier and Dr. C. H. Berendt. They
do not appear to indicate the slightest relationship either between
themselves, or with any other known stocks. The careful researches
of Lucien Adam on the Musquito grammar do not bring
it into connection either with the Carib or the Chibcha families,
with which it has sometimes been supposed to be affined.</p>

<p>The Lenca dialects, of four of which I have vocabularies, do not
differ materially, but the exact distribution of the stock at the
period of the conquest is uncertain.</p>

<p>The Guatuso is taken from the vocabularies collected by Bishop
Thiel, and several times republished. The remaining three are
from MS. materials collected by Dr. C. H. Berendt. The Xinca I
have previously published, with a general discussion of the tribe,
in the <i>Proc. of the Amer. Philosoph. Soc.</i>, 1885.</p>

<p>The Matagalpan or “Chontal of Nicaragua” (see <i>anté</i>, p. <a href="#Page_149">149</a>),
is from the vocabulary collected by the Rev. Victor Noguera. It
appears to stand quite alone. A few remote resemblances to the
Talamanca dialects of Costa Rica seem to exist, which, if real,
would connect the Matagalpan with South American stocks.</p>

<p>The Cuna and the Changuina or Dorasque are from M. Alph.
Pinart’s various publications on these dialects; the Andaqui from
the collections of the Presbyter Albis; and the Tucura, a Choco
dialect, from the report of Dr. A. Ernst (<i>Zeitschrift für Ethnologie</i>,
1887, 302). The last mentioned was obtained on the upper
Sinu river, near the junction of the Rio Verde. It is not of the
San Blas (Cuna) family, but clearly Choco.</p>

<p>I have already referred (p. <a href="#Page_200">200</a>) to some slight similarity of the
Andaqui to the Chibcha; but until we have more extensive material
of the former, the question must be left open.</p>

<p>The Choco family had probably at one time a much wider extension
than we are familiar with in historic times. I have suggested
(<i>anté</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_274">274</a>, <a href="#Page_275">275</a>), that even the sparse material for comparison
as yet available seems to indicate an affinity with the
Betoya stock. As our knowledge of the Orinoco and the Columbian
region extends, probably other tribes will be discovered
speaking related dialects. The four vocabularies which I give
above serve to illustrate the comparatively slight differences of the
phonetics. Another dialect, the Tucará (see <i>anté</i>, p. <a href="#Page_176">176</a>, note),
is given on the preceding page.</p>

<p>The relations of the Chibcha dialects are so important in their
bearings on the question of the migrations from South into North
America, that in addition to the specific comparisons on page 186,
I here add vocabularies of six dialects; three, the Chibcha, Aroac
and Chimila, from south of the Isthmus, and three, the Guaymi,
Talamanca and Boruca, from north of it.</p>

<p>The Chibcha proper is a language of extremely difficult phonetics
for a European, and doubtless the Spanish orthography, in
which it is rendered, is far from accurate.</p>

<p>The fundamental identity of the dialects of the stock becomes
much more apparent after a study of their laws of phonetic variation,
as set forth by Dr. Max Uhle (<i>anté</i>, p. <a href="#Page_185">185</a>).</p>

<p>The Talamanca and Boruca are Chibcha dialects (see preceding
page). The Paniquita (see <i>anté</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_190">190-192</a>) has no positive affinities
with its neighbors. The grammatical character of its Paez
dialect has been analyzed by Fr. Müller (<i>Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft</i>,
Bd. II., Ab. I., p. 356). He points out some similarity
in the numerals to the Kechua and Goajiro. But this is not
significant.</p>

<p>The various vocabularies of the Timote stock differ considerably,
and none of them is at all complete.</p>

<p>A comparison of the above vocabularies will probably strengthen
the supposition I have advanced (<i>anté</i>, p. <a href="#Page_199">199</a>), that these two
stocks were originally branches of one and the same. The material
on all the dialects is scanty, and for a proper grammatical collation
is quite wanting. As they are yet living idioms, it is to be hoped
that some energetic traveler will supply the facts to solve the
question. The sources of the vocabularies are indicated in the
text.</p>

<p>The wide differences between the four main Peruvian stocks are
seen in the above vocabularies. The Kechua and Aymara alone
have anything in common. The Yunca is presented in the Mochica
dialect, which is that adopted by Carrera in his Grammar. The
vocabulary of the Etenes, as furnished by Bastian, differs from it
only in the word for “eye,” <i>tassack</i>, and “head,” <i>chätz</i>, which is
remarkable, considering the extreme difficulty of the Yunca phonetics.
The grammars of these three tongues are carefully analyzed
by Fr. Müller.</p>

<p>The Atacameño words are from the authorities quoted on p. <a href="#Page_227">227</a>.
Of its grammar we have only the imperfect account furnished by
San Roman, which seems to remove it from the character of the
Kechua and Aymara.</p>

<p>The four chief stocks of the eastern Amazon region present a
fundamental diversity both in vocabulary and grammar. The Arawak
is shown as it is, as current in Guiana and along the northern
affluents of the Amazon; the Tapuya is in the dialect of the Botocudos,
as presented by Dr. Paul Ehrenreich; the Tupi is the
“lingua geral” of Brazil; and the Kiriri is from the <i>Arte</i> of
Mamiani.</p>

<p>In most of the South Atlantic stocks the numerals are imperfectly
developed, all quantities above three being usually expressed
by compound words.</p>

<p>These four vocabularies of some dialects of the Arawak stock,
from localities wide apart, disclose extensive variations from the
standard tongue. They are, however, rather apparent than real,
and often depend on either variations in orthography, or the substitution
of synonymous or allied words. This is well seen in the
comparative table of thirty-six Arawak dialects presented in tabular
form by Karl von den Steinen in his <i>Durch Central-Brasilien</i>,
s. 294. Neither he nor Adam includes the Chontaquiro in the
Arawak stock, but a comparison of vocabularies leaves no doubt
about it. The Chontaquiro prefix <i>hue</i> is the Piapoco <i>gua</i>, = “thy.”</p>

<p>The oldest existing forms of the Carib stock are believed by Von
den Steinen to be preserved in the Bakairi, which I have accordingly
placed first in the vocabularies of this family.</p>

<p>The Motilone, which is placed beside it, is one of the most
northwestern dialects, and shows singular tenacity of the radicals
of the language.</p>

<p>The Guaque, which is substantially the same as the Carijona, is
the extreme western member of the family, but presents unmistakably
the physiognomy of the stock.</p>

<p>Of the Tamanaca I have seen but incomplete specimens, but on
account of its former importance, I insert it in this connection.</p>

<p>The Roucouyenne and Macuchi are dialects on either slope of
the sierra south of Guyana. Both appear to have been affected by
their proximity to the Arawak stock.</p>

<p>The Maquiritare of the Orinoco and the Cumanagoto of the
northern portion of Venezuela are comparatively closely related,
and both present few foreign elements.</p>

<p>We may expect a thorough treatment of the comparative grammar
of the Carib dialects from M. Lucien Adam, who is engaged
in this study at the present time.</p>

<p>A large amount of material has been collected by Von den
Steinen, of which but a small portion has been published. It relates
principally to the southern Carib dialects.</p>

<p>The Opone and the Carare have evidently been subjected to
foreign influences, but still retain the characteristics of the Carib
dialects.</p>

<p>The Peba and the Yahua are not attached to the Carib family.
They, however, reveal the traces of its influence, and appear to
have adopted many words from it. Probably they are largely jargons,
and between themselves indicate a rather close relationship.</p>

<p>Of the Saliva, which seems to stand alone, the materials are inadequate.
Some texts, with an effort at a grammatical analysis,
are given in the <i>Mithridates</i>, III., s. 625.</p>

<p>The above four <i>lengue matrice</i> were among the most important
on the Orinoco. The Guaraouna or Warrau was, and continues to
be, spoken by the tribes of the delta, who are numerous and intelligent,
when they have a fair chance to live undisturbed.</p>

<p>Of the Otomaca only the merest fragments have been published,
and my vocabulary is nearly empty.</p>

<p>Several recent travelers have brought back information about the
Piaroa and Guahiba, some of which may be found in the eighth

<p>The Omagua is a well-marked Tupi dialect. Adam has shown
the grammatical concordances clearly (<i>Compte-Rendu du Cong.
des Amer.</i>, 1888, p. 496).</p>

<p>The Yarura and Betoya reveal faint resemblances in the words
for “sun” and “tongue”; but not enough to justify assuming a
relationship. Their grammars are quite unlike, that of the Yarura
preceding by suffixes, that of the Betoya by prefixes (see Müller,
<i>Sprachwissenschaft</i>, Bd. II., Ab. I., s. 361).</p>

<p>The Correguaje shows less analogy to the Betoya in the above
vocabulary than in a more extended comparison. The word for
water, <i>ocŏ</i>, reappears in a number of dialects not akin to this stock,
and is perhaps allied to the Chinchasuyu <i>yacu</i> (see <i>anté</i>, p. <a href="#Page_205">205</a>).</p>

<p>The grammatical and phonetic relations of the Pano stock have
been judiciously analyzed by M. Raoul de la Grasserie (<i>Compte-Rendu
du Cong. des Amer.</i>, 1888, p. 438, sq.). The Pano and
Culino are seen to be closely connected, those who use the one
doubtless understanding the other.</p>

<p>The Baré, which is an Arawak dialect, I have inserted here for
the sake of convenience.</p>

<p>The Puinavi is unclassified (see <i>anté</i>, p. <a href="#Page_278">278</a>). In the few words
above given, those for “sun,” “water,” and “foot” appear to
have affinities to the Baré.</p>

<p>The Catoquina and Ticuna are mixed dialects or jargons, but
clearly related to each other. Martius hesitated whether to assign
them to his “Guck” or his “Gês” stem. They both contain elements
of the Arawak, probably by borrowing. Locally they are
neighbors. The vocabulary of Ticuna is from Paul Marcoy’s work.</p>

<p>The Tucano, which is in the form obtained by Coudreau, shows
elements of Betoya and Arawak. Its relationship to the Tapuya is
not fully established.</p>

<p>The Zaparo from the Putumayo is from the collection of Osculati.
It does not seem in any way related to the great stocks of the
Amazonian region.</p>

<p>The interesting group of the Tacana stock is illustrated above
by three of its dialects. I regret that the recent publication on
the Arauna by Rev. Nicolas Armentia (<i>Navegacion del Rio Madre
de Dios</i>) has not been accessible to me.</p>

<p>The scanty vocabulary of the Araua does not permit any extended
study of its relations.</p>

<p>I call attention to the numerals of the Sapibocona and Cayubaba
as given above and on page 360. Prof. Fr. Müller has transposed
the two in his lists of examples (<i>Sprachwissenschaft</i>, II., I., p. 438.
Compare <i>Mithridates</i>, III., p. 576).</p>

<p>The variety of stocks on the Bolivian highlands is clearly shown
by the vocabularies on this and the following page. I have taken
them from the D’Orbigny MSS., in the Bibliothèque Nationale,
Paris, the collections of Hervas, and the papers of E. Heath in the
<i>Kansas City Review</i>, 1883. I have not been able to connect any
one of the eight tongues with any other, although each has some
words which have been borrowed from others or from some common
stock. Thus, the Yurucare <i>suñe</i>, man, Mosetena <i>zoñi</i>, Chiquito
<i>ñoñich</i>, are too similar not to be from the same radical. It
must be remembered that the Chiquito was adopted by the missionaries
as the general language for instruction, and other tribes
were persuaded to learn it whenever possible. Thus some of its
words came to be substituted for those originally familiar to the
speakers.</p>

<p>The Chiquito and the Yurucare are the only tongues of the eight
given of which I have found satisfactory grammatical notices; and
that of the latter is still unpublished (see <i>anté</i>, p. <a href="#Page_297">297</a>).</p>

<p>The three dialects of the Guaycuru stock above given show considerable
diversity. The first is from Castelnau, the second from
Fontana, the third (Toba) from Carranza and de Angelis. The
Payagua is also from Fontana (<i>Revista de la Soc. Geog. Argentina</i>,
1887, p. 352, sq.).</p>

<p>All the Chaco tribes are singularly defective in numeration.
Pelleschi says that intelligent chiefs among them cannot count the
fingers of one hand. Above the two numerals are generally compound
words and have not fixed forms.</p>

<p>The near relationship of the Lule, Vilela and Chunupi appears
clear from the above comparison. The Chunupi words are taken
from Fontana (<i>ubi suprá</i>), the Vilela from the vocabulary of Gilii’s
<i>Storia Americana</i>, and the Lule from Machoni’s Grammar.</p>

<p>The Mataco is also from Fontana, and represents the dialect as
spoken to-day. The words marked D. are from the D’Orbigny
MSS.</p>

<p>The vocabularies of the Guachis, Guatos and Carajas are from
the collections of Castelnau (<i>Expédition</i>, Tome V., Appendix);
that of the Araucanian from Febres’ <i>Diccionario</i>.</p>

<p>The Guachis are classed as belonging to the Guaranis (Tupi
stock), and by tradition came from the west (see <i>anté</i>, p. <a href="#Page_233">233</a>). A
comparison with the Samucu vocabulary (page 359) seems to me
to suggest several resemblances which would be worth further
study on more extended material.</p>

<p>The Guatos may be a mixed off-shoot of the Tapuya stock, as has
been suggested (<i>anté</i>, p. <a href="#Page_318">318</a>). Of the Caraja, we must await the
publication of the abundant material collected by Dr. Paul Ehrenreich.</p>

<p>The vocabularies of the Tsoneca, Tehuelhet or Patagonian differ
considerably in the various writers. No. 1 is from Von Martius,
completed from D’Orbigny’s lists. No. 2 is based on Lt. Muster’s
examples, supplemented from the vocabularies in Ramon Lista’s
<i>Exploraciones</i>.</p>

<p>The Yahgan and Alikuluf pass for independent stocks. Yet in
a number of words they resemble each other, and in a few, for example,
those for “eye,” “woman,” “moon,” “man,” there seems
more than a chance similarity.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_24">24</a>. <span class="smcap">Auriferous Gravels of California.</span> The principal
reference is J. D. Whitney, <i>The Auriferous Gravels of the Sierra
Nevada of California</i>, pp. 258-288 (Cambridge, Mass., 1879). Professor
Whitney believes that the evidence is sufficient to attribute
the mortars, pestles, beads, etc., found in the auriferous gravels to
late pliocene man. But Dr. Joseph Leidy describes equine skulls,
molars, incisors, etc., found in these gravels, thirty-five to forty
feet below the surface, “not differing in any respect from those
of the modern horse,” and “unchanged in texture” (see <i>ibid.</i>, p.
257). Dr. Leidy informs me personally that for such reasons he
gravely doubts the antiquity of the formation, and distrusts the
great age of the human relics it contains.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>. <span class="smcap">Palæolithic Implements</span>. Reports of the discovery of
very large numbers of supposed palæolithic implements in various
parts of the United States have been collected and published by
Mr. Thomas Wilson in the <i>Report of the U. S. National Museum</i>,
1887-88, pp. 677-702. These implements, however, are called
palæolithic from their form and workmanship only, and not from
the stratigraphic relations in which they were found. As palæolithic
forms often survived in the riper culture of the neolithic age,
the only positive proof of their older origin must be that they are
found in undisturbed relation to older strata.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_33">33</a>. <span class="smcap">Remains of Man in the Equus Beds</span>. What American
geologists call the Equus Beds are those which yield in abundance
the bones of various species of fossil horse, as <i>E. major</i>, <i>occidentalis</i>,
<i>excelsus</i>, <i>barcenæi</i>, <i>fraternus</i>, <i>crenidens</i>, etc., most of
which have been determined by Dr. Joseph Leidy and Prof. E. D.
Cope. The principal localities of these beds are: 1. The Oregon
Desert; 2. The country of the Nueces, in southwestern Texas;
and 3. The valley of Mexico. The horizon to which these beds
should be referred was considered by Prof. King to be the Upper
Pliocene; but by Prof. G. K. Gilbert, Dr. Joseph Leidy, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
think, by Prof. Cope, it is rather held to be pleistocene or early
quaternary, probably as old as the great glacial phenomena of the
Continent. According to Cope and Gilbert, rude stone implements
have undoubtedly been found <i>in place</i> in the Equus beds of Nevada,
California and Southwestern Texas. See the <i>American
Naturalist</i>, 1889, p. 165; <i>Proc. Acad. Nat. Sciences</i>, Phila., 1883,
p. 134, sq.</p>

<p>Pp. <a href="#Page_106">106</a>, <a href="#Page_108">108</a>. <span class="smcap">Kwakiutl and Nootka Stocks</span>. After the
pages referred to had been printed, I received, through the kindness
of Mr. Horatio Hale, advance sheets of the Sixth Annual Report
of the Committee of the British Association on the tribes of
the Northwest Coast, prepared by Dr. Franz Boas, with an introduction
by Mr. Hale, and including eighteen vocabularies. Dr.
Boas’ researches furnish clear evidence of a connection between
the Kwakiutl and the Nootka tongues, and there is little doubt that
they are distantly related. An instructive article on the physical
characteristics of the Indians of the North Pacific coast is contributed
by Dr. Boas to the <i>American Anthropologist</i> for January,
1891. His conclusion is: “Each tribe appears composed of many
types, but in each we find a marked prevalence of a certain type.”</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_123">123</a>. <span class="smcap">Supposed Connection of Sonoran Languages with
the Maya Stock</span>. In his <i>Etudes Aztèques</i>, published in the
<i>Museon</i>, 1890, p. 506, M. W. Baligny endeavors to show a connection
between the vocabularies of Sonoran languages and the Maya
dialects. His strong points are some of the numerals and the personal
pronouns of the first and second person. I have elsewhere
given good reasons for not depending on these pronominal analogies
in American languages (see <i>Essays of an Americanist</i>, p.
396). And as to the numerals, “dont la ressemblance est évidente”
(according to him), when the Sonoran tongues disagree with the
Nahuatl, they have almost always clearly borrowed from the Yuma
stem, as in “two,” <i>guoca</i>, <i>kuak</i> (see <i>Vocabs.</i>, <i>anté</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_335">335</a>, <a href="#Page_336">336</a>).</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_163">163</a>. <span class="smcap">Language of the Ramas</span>. Since my negative observations

missionary on the Musquito coast. The orthography is German.</p>

<p>My informant writes me that the Ramas are about 250 in number,
and are all Christians and able to speak and write English, except
a few very old persons. Their language will probably be
extinct in a few years. They are confined to their island in Blewfield
Lagoon. It is particularly interesting, therefore, to fix their
affinities before the opportunity passes. From the above vocabulary
I think there is little doubt but that they are a branch of the
Changuina or Dorasque stock, described pp. <a href="#Page_174">174, 175</a>. The following
words attest this, the Changuina forms being from A. L. Pinart’s
<i>Vocabulario Castellano-Dorasque, Dialectos Chumulu, Gualaca
y Changuina</i> (Paris, 1890):</p>

<p>The numerals for “two” and “three,” <i>puk sak</i>, <i>pang sak</i>, are
doubtless the Cuna <i>pocua</i>, <i>pagua</i>. The Ramas, therefore, belong
to the Isthmian tribes, and formed the vanguard of the South
American immigration into North America. What time they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
moved northward and possessed themselves of their small island is
unknown, but it was probably after the conquest. Mr. Siebärger
writes me: “They were always kept under, even ill-treated,
by the Musquito Indians, and are still very submissive and teachable.”</p>

<p>The terminal syllable <i>to</i> in the Telembi words for hand and foot
appears to be the Colorado <i>té</i>, branch, which is also found in the
Col. <i>té-michu</i>, finger, <i>te-chili</i>, arm ornament, and again in the Telembi

the terminal <i>pula</i> is generic, and the prefixes are the Colorado
<i>sona</i>, woman, abbreviated to <i>so</i> in the Colorado itself, (see Dr.
Seler’s article, p. 55); and the Col. <i>chilla</i>, male, which in the

of <i>g</i> and <i>l</i>, not known in southern Kechua. The differences in the

Chin. <i>rupay</i>, sun, is the K. for sun’s heat (ardor del sol); Chin.

Among the D’Orbigny MSS. in the Bibliothèque Nationale, I found
an inedited grammar and dictionary of the Yurucari language. It
would be very desirable to have this published, as our present
knowledge of the tongue rests on a few imperfect vocabularies.
The work is doubtless that by P. la Cueva, mentioned in H. Ludewig,
<i>Lit. of Amer. Aborig. Languages</i>, p. 206; but the author and
editor of that work were in error in classing the Tacana and Maropa
as members of the Yurucari stock. They belong to a different
family.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
